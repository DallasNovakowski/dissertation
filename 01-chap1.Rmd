# Experiments on Inequality and Security Consumption {#ineq-exp}

Despite evidence for inequality's role in increasing risk-taking, simulation, cross-country, and panel data suggest that inequality also fosters a special case of risk aversion: low social trust [@knack1997; @zak2001; @berggren2006; @leigh2006; @bjørnskov2007; @wilkinson2010; @elgar2010; @barone2016; @decourson2021]. For instance, @barone2016 found that among OECD countries, inequality is associated with lower country-level trust, as computed from the World Values Survey. Several theoretical streams have emerged to explain how inequality reduces trust.

<!--# Each of these explanations are limited to certain contexts; for example, ranging from changes in intergroup contact, opportunity costs of vigilance, and incentives for antisocial behaviour [reviewed in @jordahl2007]. -->

## Inequality and Distrust

Scholarly work on the relationship between inequality and trust remains in its early stages, although a few theoretical streams have emerged for different mechanisms by which inequality reduces trust. The **social barriers** argument suggests that with inequality, income level increasingly becomes a source of dissimilarity between individuals, and that individuals begin to demonstrate a group membership bias towards individuals of their own income group, and exhibit less trust for the income outgroup. The **inference on social relationship** explanation argues that people interpret the presence of inequality as evidence of exploitation and injustice, and infer that other individuals (especially those at the top of the income distribution) are untrustworthy. The **resource conflict** explanation posits that inequality "magnifies the incentives for deceitful behaviour," which "will make people with more resources less inclined to trust [poor people]" (p. 5) [@jordahl2007]. The **opportunity cost** explanation lastly assumes that inequality causes poor people to spend more time verifying whether social partners can be trusted, because their opportunities are far less profitable (i.e., their opportunity costs of distrusting are lower) than for wealthy people.

NEED TO REINTRODUCE RISK-INEQUALITY, RISK SENSITIVITY

Another account of how economic inequality leads to distrust is a so-called **psychosocial effect** [@decourson2021]. The authors use a simulation to show how, in unequal environments, worse-off individuals will tend to be in poverty, and will try to exploit cooperative groups to surpass desperation thresholds (e.g., affording rent; in their account, labelled as the **compositional effect** of inequality). After observing those exploitative behaviours, others in a population become distrustful, eventually avoiding cooperation altogether.

Decourson and Nettle's theory of inequality-distrust focuses on the cascading effects of poverty (i.e. absolute deprivation). However, the authors also suggest that an individual's threshold for desperation is not a fixed dollar value. Instead, a belief whether one's resources are sufficient can be shaped by comparisons to normal standards of living, in addition to comparisons with nearby social partners [@mishra2017]. This project seeks to elaborate on these considerations of *relative deprivation* (i.e., envy). In particular, the proposed extension is that inequality will lead to reduced trust without individuals needing to observe the risky or criminal activities in the population, because people will try to limit their exposure to envious reactions.

<!--# Despite evidence for the risk-inducing effects of inequality, simulation and panel data suggest that inequality also fosters a special case of risk aversion: low social trust [@elgar2010; @barone2016; @decourson2021a]. At least in part, (dis)trust reflects one's expectation that others will cause them harm/benefit [@schul2008; @hardin2006]. Accordingly, distrustful behaviours incur costs (or forego benefits) in order to reduce one's vulnerability to other actors [@mcevily2012].  -->

## Envy avoidance

People seem to be wary of being envied. Data from small-scale preindustrial societies suggests that many individuals hold "evil eye beliefs," superstitions that a mere envious glance can cause real, material harm. These beliefs are most prevalent in societies with high wealth inequality, and especially where one's resources are easily visible and vulnerable to third parties.[@gershman2015] These patterns of envy avoidance seem adaptive when considering the risk- and conflict- inducing effects of inequality. If envious peers are more likely to be hostile and take risks, it may be helpful to anticipate when one's neighbors will feel relatively deprived, and to protect oneself from spiteful or desperate behaviours.[@gershman2014; @brams2005]

<!--# This project seeks to test an envy-avoidance theory of distrust, which generally predicts that inequality reduces trust towards less well-off individuals among a reference group. The hypothesized mechanism for this project is that individuals expect envy from disadvantaged partners, and that these individuals consequently make efforts to protect themselves against the possibility of peers' hostile or risky behaviours. This envy-avoidance theory of distrust makes similar directional predictions as some existing inequality-distrust theories, but makes these predictions under more generalized circumstances. Even in the absence of absolute poverty, changes in intergroup contact, larger material incentives for antisocial behaviour, or different opportunity costs, this model would still predict that inequality increases distrust and security consumption, out of the person's efforts to protect themselves against envious reactions. -->

Currently, the most rigorous investigation of how inequality impacts distrust in populations is found in a simulation study by @decourson2021. They found that in unequal environments, worse-off individuals will tend to be in poverty, and will try to exploit cooperative groups (as suggested by risk-sensitivity theory), leading others in a population to eventually avoid cooperation altogether. @decourson2021's theory is explicitly focused on poverty (i.e. absolute deprivation). However, in many instances, poverty and inequality do not co-occur. For instance, some workplaces and neighborhoods have little to no absolute deprivation, but they can still exhibit substantial stratification; in such a circumstance, @decourson2021's compositional model of inequality would not predict any reduced trust. We argue that considerations of others' relative deprivation can help to extend this inequality-trust theory to other important contexts.

People appear to demonstrate an aversion to being the subject of social comparisons and feelings of envy. Data from small-scale preindustrial societies suggests that many individuals hold "evil eye beliefs;" superstitions that a mere envious glance can cause material harm. Moreover, these beliefs are most prevalent in societies with high wealth inequality [@gershman2015]. Likewise, a major feature of scandinavian culture is the "Jante Law" (or Janteloven/Jantelagen), which explicitly discourages individual superiority, ambition, and nonconformity. [e.g., "You musn't think you are anything special;" @sandemose1936]. Anglo-Saxon societies refer to the 'cutting down' of 'tall poppies', and in Asian cultures, 'the nail that stands out gets hammered down.'

To this end, existing theories predict a "fear-of-envy" equilibrium, where concerns over partner's destructive envy can reduce people's likelihood to engage in wealth-creating behaviours.[@gershman2014; @brams2005]

Like Gershman, we argue that these envy avoidance norms have propagated as heuristics to help individuals anticipate the possibility of harmful behaviours arising from peers' envy. ----- propogated as a "useful rule of thumb approximating rational envy-avoidance behavior under conditions in which destructive envy is a real threat", - gershman 2015

### THE CREDIBLE THREAT OF EMOTIONS

If envious peers are more likely to act spitefully and take risks, being able to anticipate or detect disparities among peers may be helpful in protecting oneself from harmful behaviours. These patterns of envy aversion seem adaptive when considering the risk- and conflict- inducing effects of inequality. In fact, some existing theories already been proposed predicting a "fear-of-envy" equilibrium, where concerns over partner's destructive envy can reduce people's likelihood to engage in wealth-creating behaviours [@gershman2014; @brams2005].

For instance, consider the case of inequality aversion. Specifically, individuals exhibit a strong urge to reduce inequality when they are the victim, but a weaker desire when they are the beneficiary [@loewenstein1989]. Inequality aversion is another fixture in behavioural economics; in the Ultimatum Game, about half of (western undergraduate) participants reject proposals that represent less than 20% of the total resource [reviewed in @camerer2011]. Likewise, modal offers in this game are generally 50% of the total wealth. The prevalence of generous proposals is commonly explained by suggesting that such "generosity" is in the proposer's approximate self-interest; if responders are more likely to reject unequal offers, then a proposer's best response is to offer an equal split of the funds.

<!-- The argument that tastes for fairness are consistent with approximate self-interest has been attributed to the strategic role of emotions in social life. Frank (1988) posits that -->

One of the proposed roles of human emotion is to help communicate and coordinate behaviours between social actors. Since emotions predispose individuals to certain actions [e.g., @smith1990; @sznycer2021], emotions such as jealousy, anger, and envy can serve as psychological commitment devices, steering decision-makers away from dispassionate assessments of alternatives [@frank1988]. Such mental biases can be strategic in social interactions.

In the context of the Ultimatum Game, a payoff-maximizing responder would accept any non-zero sum, so the proposer could, in anticipation of these dispassionate preferences, offer the lowest amount possible without fear of rejection or reprisal. By contrast, a responder that has a taste for fairness may reject one-sided proposals, even if they are profitable. Such propensities for emotional reactions create a credible threat: "if I am worse off, I will get angry and make life worse for you." In anticipation of such emotional and antagonistic reactions, proposers are better off by anticipating and accommodating the responder's preference for equality. Indeed, authors have suggested that our human sense of fairness evolved as a response to the threats of inequity aversion and spiteful behaviours [@brosnan2014; @forber2014].

This project seeks to test an envy-avoidance theory of distrust, which generally predicts that *inequality reduces trust towards less well-off individuals among a reference group*. The hypothesized mechanism for this project is that individuals expect envy from disadvantaged partners, and that these individuals consequently make efforts to protect themselves against the possibility of peers' hostile or risky behaviours. This envy-avoidance theory of distrust makes similar directional predictions as some existing inequality-distrust theories, but makes these predictions under more generalized circumstances. Even in the absence of absolute poverty, changes in intergroup contact, larger material incentives for antisocial behaviour, or different opportunity costs, this model would still predict that inequality increases distrust and security consumption, out of the person's efforts to protect themselves against envious reactions.

<!--# A payoff-maximizing actor will often obtain worse outcomes by neglecting the emotional reactions and "irrational" preferences of their social partners. As such, an actor with the capacity to experience visible emotions with predictable responses can receive better treatment from otherwise self-serving partners, who are right to be wary of any emotional and potentially destructive reactions -->

<!-- with commitment problems [@frank1988]. Over the lifespan of these exchanges, agents often encounter opportunities to secretly benefit themselves, at the cost of their partners. -->

<!-- Given the observed relationship between inequality and risk-taking and conflict, consumers’ implicit or explicit anticipation of others’ reactions to inequality may influence their own purchasing behaviour. Shaw et al. (2014) found that children would rather throw a resource in the trash than distribute it unequally, suggesting that concerns over equity are deeply ingrained from an early age. Given that interpersonal security products are specifically designed to deter antagonistic social partners, the proposition follows that 1) when inequality increases (whether in income or wealth), individuals will spend more on security goods. -->

<!--# The relative state model [@mishra2017] posits that individuals take risks not only to escape material destitution, but also to keep up with competitors. As a result, risk-taking can be influenced by social comparisons. As wealth distributions become more skewed, so do comparison standards. Under conditions of inequality, individuals set more ambitious goals, and subsequently take more risks, as they try to close the gap between their current state and their aspiration levels[@payne2017]. Likewise, being worse off than others can lead to emotional responses of envy and personal relative deprivation, which can be linked to gambling as well as spiteful behaviours [@callan2008; @wobker2015].  -->

## Methods

### Sample characteristics

Participants will be recruited through the crowdsourcing platform Prolific Academic. Sampled participants will be filtered for fluency in English, balanced for an equal gender representation, participation through computer (vs. smartphone/tablet), and only eligible if they have not completed an earlier experiment in this series. After data collection, participants will be screened based on an attention check and one item testing their task comprehension. After data collection, participants will be excluded from analyses unless they pass the attention and comprehension check items. Participants will also be excluded if they have erroneous or missing data for any of the measures.

The Prolific-recruited participants will complete the studies on oTree [@chen2016], an open-source platform for conducting single- and multi-player experiments and surveys. oTree studies are written largely in html, python, and javascript, which can be saved and shared in their raw code form, allowing for easy sharing, reproduction, and modification of protocols.

### Experimental procedures

The experiments across both Chapters 1 and 2 will be conducted in the context of a two-player economic game, called the security game[@tambe2011]. At its base form, the game is one-shot, extensive-form, and conducted with complete information.

In this modification of the security game, participants are (supposedly) paired with an anonymous partner, with each being given an endowment of funds (e.g., \$2 each). Then, participants are told that their partner will have the opportunity to try to steal money from them (e.g., \$1 at a 50% chance of success, with failed thievery attempts instead making the partner lose \$1). After learning this information, participants can spend some of their money on security products (e.g., \$0.02 per unit), with each unit of security visibly reducing the probability of a successful thievery attempt (1% reduction per unit).

#### The Security Game

As a more formal summary of the procedure: After receiving initial incomes ($x_D$ = Defender's income, $x_A$ = Attacker's income), the Defender will be told that the Attacker will have the option to attempt to steal (*q*: 1 = steal, 0 = do not steal) amount $s$ (0 \< $s$ $\le$ $x_D$) from the Defender with a base probability of $p_g$ (*g* : successful thievery, 0 \< $p_g$ \< 1). However, if the Attacker has an unsuccessful thievery attempt (with probability = 1 -- $p_g$), they will lose the amount *k* (0 \< *k* $\le$ $x_A$). After learning this information, the Defender will have the option to purchase *z* units of security; each unit of security costs *m* (0 \< *m*), and reduces the probability of a successful thievery attempt by $p_z$ (0 \< $p_z$ \< 1). See Table \@ref(tab:gloss-table) for glossary of terms for this game. The expected value functions for the Defender (Equation \eqref{eq:defender-ev}) and Attacker (Equation \eqref{eq:attacker-ev}) can be expressed as:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  \pi_D &= x_D - zm - q\{s(p_g - zp_z)\}

In written terms, Attackers will seek to maximize their payoff through the combination of their initial endowment and the expected payoff of their decision to attempt an attack. Their ability to profit from an attack is determined by the base probability of attacks being successful, which may be reduced by the amount of security purchased by the Defender. Likewise, Attackers lose from unsuccessful attempts. In sum, Attackers will choose to attempt an attack when the attack's expected value exceeds the payoff of not attacking.

Constrained by their budget, an expected value-maximizing Defender then seeks to the optimal combination of their initial endowment, the price spent on security, and the expected loss of being targeted by the Attacker. As such, expensive security products need to be accompanied with substantial reductions in an attack's success rate in order to be worth the investment.

Critically, expected cost of being attacked is weighted by the probability of the attacker making the attempt. A Defender is generally worse off if they consume some security, but not enough to make an attack unprofitable. This formulation thus emphasizes (and assumes) that security measures can be a credible deterrent, where security consumption reduces the Attackers' likelihood of successfully stealing. Given that the Attacker's decision to attack is heavily influenced by the effort's probability of success, visible security consumption reduces the probability of an attack being attempted.

The security game experiments will take place across four studies, split across Chapters 1 and 2, testing the effects of inequality on security consumption (Study 1a), with real monetary payoffs (1b). The last two experiments (in Chapter 2) will assess the effects of inequality when endowments are due to one's own efforts (versus random; 2a), and whether apparent group-based discrimination increases security consumption under constant of inequality (2b). Except for Study 2b, for each study, inequality will be randomly assigned as a between-subjects condition.

Economic games examining self-protection are not new. Most notably, McEvily[@mcevily2012] devised a behavioural distrust game, and found that participants are very willing to pay money to guarantee that their partner splits a surplus income equally. Compared to the distrust game, the security game is explicitly probabilistic; partners have a risky choice to try stealing funds for themselves, and security expenditures reduce the probability of successful "attacks." The risky nature of the security game is particularly useful for this project because the targeted theory of envy avoidance focuses on the anticipation of increased risk-taking.

### Pilot data (Study 1)

A within-subjects pretest with an initial sample of `r pretest_initial_n` crowdsourced (Prolific) participants was conducted to calibrate the price of security (\$0.02 vs. \$0.04) and the baseline likelihood of successful thefts (50%, 60%, 75%). The pretest had two attention checks and implemented a relaxed comprehension check (selecting one of two options out of five), as only `r round(screened_n/pretest_initial_n*100,0)`% of participants correctly answered a single-item comprehension check, leaving n = `r screened_n` retained participants. As described in the procedure above, participants were told they would be paired with a hypothetical partner, and each would be given \$2. Then, participants were told that this partner would have the opportunity to steal \$1 from them, at a baseline chance of success, with unsuccessful thefts instead making the partner lose \$1. Then, participants were asked to indicate how much of a security product they would like to purchase, with each unit of the product costing money, and reducing the likelihood of a successful theft by 1%.

A 2w\*3w within-subjects ANOVA failed to detect significant effects of baseline likelihood of successful thefts, `r anova_extract(pretest_anova,"prob")`, nor security price, `r anova_extract(pretest_anova,"cost")`; see Figure \@ref(fig:pretest-splitplot) and Table \@ref(tab:pretest-anova)). This project will use a baseline 50% chance of successful thefts, and each unit of security costing \$0.02 (or proportional equivalent). This condition seems to produce the lowest means and the least skewed data, at `r round(base_skew,2)` (vs. skew = `r round(skew_groups["75_02"],2)` when probability is 75% and price \$0.02).

### Measurement and variables (Study 1)

Throughout these experiments, participants will be asked to choose how many units of a security product they wish to consume, ranging from 0 to 50. For the purposes of analysis and interpretation, security spending will serve as the final dependent variable where possible. Security spending will be computed by multiplying the number of security units consumed by the good's per-unit cost. Before participants make their security decision, they will be asked a battery of self-report questions about the game. For example, before their security decision, participants will be rate their agreement with the statements, "my partner is probably going to try stealing from me", and "my partner probably feels jealous of me."

Given the constraints on the minimum and maximum values for the variables in the experimental designs, outliers are considered legitimate values and will not be deleted. Instead, influential observations will be winzorized to the 5th and 95th percentile values. Influential observations will be flagged as having cook's distance values exceeding the threshold 4/n; where n = \# of observations.

### Study 1a: Inequality and security spending

The first experiment will use a mixed (2b\*2w) design in a hypothetical context, manipulating economic inequality (yes vs. no) between-subjects, and stake size (\$2 vs. \$300) within-subjects, to test whether **H1)** `r tolower(hypotheses[1])` (Table \@ref(tab:design-table)), versus **H1~0~)** no significant effect of inequality. Participants will be asked to imagine that they are paired with another participant, where they will each be assigned to different roles (Blue or Yellow), and endowed with money. In the equal condition, participants will be told that their partner received the same amount of funds as themselves (e.g., \$2). In the unequal condition, participants will be told that their partner instead received only half their endowment (e.g. \$1).

Before participants make their security decisions, they will be asked four questions on whether they think their partner would be envious of them (e.g., "My partner probably feels envious of me"). Contingent on sufficient internal consistency, these items will be summed and used to test whether **H2)** `r hyp2_min[1]` versus **H2~0~)** no significant indirect effect of anticipated partner envy from inequality to security consumption. This procedure has a notable strength by controlling the participant's income across levels of inequality (as the partner's money is the only income that changes). Since stake size will be manipulated within-subjects, two sets of responses for game-related self-report items and security consumption decisions will be analyzed using a mixed ANOVA model and mediation analyses.

#### A priori power analysis (Study 1a)

Using mean and standard deviation values of security expenditure from the pretest (*M*=`r round(base_mean,2)`, *SD*=`r round(base_sd,2)`), an a priori power analysis has been conducted using r package SuperPower [@lakens2021] (see Figures \@ref(fig:mixed-design) and \@ref(fig:powerplot2) and and Tables \@ref(tab:2b2w-anova-exact) and \@ref(tab:2b2w-pairwise-power)). Given the unknown size of the hypothesized effect, this study will target an effect size of cohen's f = `r round(security_exact_5$main_results$cohen_f[1],2)`, which corresponds to a pattern of means yielding a cohen's d = .2 in an independent-samples t-test; a small effect according to statistical convention[@cohen1988]. To achieve 95% power with one tail, studies must have a minimum of n = `r round(cell_n_5,0)` participants per between-subjects cell, or a study-wide total of n = `r format(round(cell_n_5*2,0),big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)`.

### Study 1b: Inequality with real payoffs

The use of hypothetical scenarios in Study 1a may limit the reliability of any results. For instance, compared to hypothetical rewards, participants take fewer risks when incentivized by real payoffs and experiencing negative feedback.[@xu2016; @hertwig2001] Study 1b will serve to replicate Study 1a, with the sole difference being that **H1)** and **H1a)** are being tested when participants believe they are playing with a real partner, and that their decision could have real payoffs. Specifically, participants will be entered in a lottery where three participants will be selected to receive the payoff from one of their decisions.

This study will also use a mixed (2b\*2w) experimental design, manipulating inequality (yes vs. no) between-subjects, and the starting probabilities of successful thefts (50% vs. 60%) within-subjects. All conditions will have a stake size of \$300 (\$3 security cost and \$150 gains/losses from thefts). Study 1b will determine its targeted sample size by seeking 95% a priori for the observed main effect of inequality in Study 1a. If Study 1a fails to find a significant effect of inequality, Study 1b will again target an effect size of cohen's f = `r round(security_exact_5$main_results$cohen_f[1],2)` (n=`r format(round(cell_n_5*2,0),big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)`). Results will be analyzed using a mixed ANOVA and mediation analyses.
