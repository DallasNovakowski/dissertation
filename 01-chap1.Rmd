# Experiments on Inequality and Security Consumption {#ineq-exp}

Despite evidence for inequality's role in increasing risk-taking, simulation, cross-country, and panel data suggest that inequality also fosters a special case of risk aversion: low social trust [@knack1997; @zak2001; @berggren2006; @leigh2006; @bjørnskov2007; @wilkinson2010; @elgar2010; @decourson2021]. For instance, @barone2016 found that among OECD countries, inequality is associated with lower country-level trust, as computed from the World Values Survey. Several theoretical streams have emerged to explain how inequality reduces trust.

<!--# Each of these explanations are limited to certain contexts; for example, ranging from changes in intergroup contact, opportunity costs of vigilance, and incentives for antisocial behaviour [reviewed in @jordahl2007]. -->

## Inequality and Distrust

Scholarly work on the relationship between inequality and trust remains in its early stages, although a few theoretical streams have emerged for different mechanisms by which inequality reduces trust [reviewed in @jordahl2007]. The **social barriers** argument suggests that with inequality, income level increasingly becomes a source of dissimilarity between individuals, and that individuals begin to demonstrate a group membership bias towards individuals of their own income group, and exhibit less trust for the income outgroup. The **inference on social relationship** explanation argues that people interpret the presence of inequality as evidence of exploitation and injustice, and infer that other individuals (especially those at the top of the income distribution) are untrustworthy. The **resource conflict** explanation posits that inequality "magnifies the incentives for deceitful behaviour," which "will make people with more resources less inclined to trust [poor people]" (p. 5) [@jordahl2007]. The **opportunity cost** explanation lastly assumes that inequality causes poor people to spend more time verifying whether social partners can be trusted, because their opportunities are far less profitable (i.e., their opportunity costs of distrusting are lower) than for wealthy people.

<!--# NEED TO REINTRODUCE RISK-INEQUALITY, RISK SENSITIVITY -->

Another account of how economic inequality leads to distrust is a so-called **psychosocial effect** [@decourson2021], which is posited to occur after observing inequality-driven selfishness. Borrowing from risk-sensitivity theory, in an unequal environment, worse-off are more likely to be impoverished, and try to surpass desperation thresholds (e.g., hospital bills) by exploiting cooperative groups. After observing those exploitative behaviours, others in a population become distrustful, eventually avoiding cooperation altogether. This project seeks to elaborate on these considerations of *relative deprivation* (i.e., envy). In particular, this proposed extension is that inequality will lead to reduced trust *without* individuals needing to observe the risky or criminal activities in the population, because people will try to limit their exposure to envious reactions.

<!-- Decourson and Nettle's theory of inequality-distrust focuses on the cascading effects of poverty (i.e. absolute deprivation). However, the authors also suggest that an individual's threshold for desperation is not a fixed dollar value. Instead, a belief whether one's resources are sufficient can be shaped by comparisons to normal standards of living, in addition to comparisons with nearby social partners [@mishra2017]. This project seeks to elaborate on these considerations of *relative deprivation* (i.e., envy). In particular, the proposed extension is that inequality will lead to reduced trust without individuals needing to observe the risky or criminal activities in the population, because people will try to limit their exposure to envious reactions. -->

<!--# Despite evidence for the risk-inducing effects of inequality, simulation and panel data suggest that inequality also fosters a special case of risk aversion: low social trust [@elgar2010; @barone2016; @decourson2021a]. At least in part, (dis)trust reflects one's expectation that others will cause them harm/benefit [@schul2008; @hardin2006]. Accordingly, distrustful behaviours incur costs (or forego benefits) in order to reduce one's vulnerability to other actors [@mcevily2012].  -->

## Inequality/Inequity Aversion

Concerns over relative deprivation have probably been most thoroughly investigated in the field of behavioural economics, in particular, the case of inequality/inequity aversion. Specifically, individuals exhibit a strong urge to reduce inequality when they are the victim of an unequal distribution, but a weaker desire when they are the beneficiary [@loewenstein1989]. Consider the two-player Ultimatum Game, where a Proposer offers a take-it-or-leave-it choice of split of money, and the Responder either accepts the offer, or rejects it, with both parties getting nothing. About half of (western undergraduate) participants reject proposals that represent less than 20% of the total resource. Likewise, modal proposals in this game are generally 50% of the total wealth. [reviewed in @camerer2011].

The fact that Proposers often make generous offers is unexpected under classical economic models, which predict that a payoff-maximizing Responder would accept any non-zero sum. In these models, a rational Proposer would, in anticipation of these dispassionate preferences, offer the lowest amount possible without fear of rejection or reprisal. However, "generosity" in the Ultimatum game is also in the Proposer's approximate self-interest; if Responders are more likely to reject unequal offers, then a Proposer's best response is to offer an equal split of the funds.

Proposers' surprisingly equal offers has sparked an extremely active program of research, with one of the key questions being whether this generosity is due to Proposers' tastes for fairness (they dislike producing inequality), or due to strategic behaviour to avoid rejections [reviewed in @cooper2016]. This strategy argument has been supported by observations in the Dictator game. When participants cannot reject a proposed split; modal offers drop from 50% in the Ultimatum game to 0% of the available wealth [@forsythe1994].

The current state of the literature on other-regarding preferences suggests that fairness concerns generally outstrip raw inequality (aka "difference") aversion. For instance, a Responder's decision whether to reject a proposal is made to reciprocate and punish/reward the Proposer's behaviour, considering social norms, their partner's intentions, and available alternatives [reviewed in @cooper2016]. The role of fairness in inequity aversion will be expanded upon in Chapter 2.

For the time being, the important note is that raw inequality (difference) aversion can persist beyond fairness concerns. For example, @bereby-meyer2005 has found that in a three-player Ultimatum game, Responders reject unequal offers even the proposal holds no benefit to the Proposer, which is a surprising finding according to intention-based theories of other-regarding preferences [@bolton2000; @fehr1999]. Likewise, beyond the Ultimatum game, manipulations of inequality have been demonstrated to increase envy and spiteful behaviours, even amongst children [@wobker2015; @steinbeis2013; @dawes2007].

People also *perceive* that inequality is sufficient to elicit inequity aversion; testing people's folk intuitions of whether inequity aversion is rooted in fairness, @shaw2017 found that people are unlikely to think that disadvantageous inequity aversion is a result of fairness concerns, compared to advantageous inequity aversion. Both in an evolutionary and developmental sense, disadvantageous inequity aversion appears to be an old response, being observed in capuchins, macaques, chimpanzees, domestic dogs, crows, rats, and ravens [@brosnan2014], and emerging four years earlier than advantageous inequity aversion in humans [reviewed in @shaw2017]. While fairness is obviously important to elicit inequity aversion in humans, inequality appears to be sufficient in some cases to change social behaviours. So, this chapter focuses on inequalities produced by forces outside of the interacting pair (i.e., randomness).

<!--# For the time being, the important note is that raw inequality (difference) aversion can persist beyond fairness concerns. For example, @bereby-meyer2005 used a three-player modification of the Ultimatum Game, where the Proposer (X) offers a split of resources for the other two players (Y,Z), with the Responder randomly assigned Y or Z after the proposal. However, if the Responder rejects the offer, the Proposer obtains a rejection payoff varying across conditions ($0, $5, $10). As predicted by intention-based theories [@bolton2000; @fehr1999], Responders were far more likely to accept small offers when the Proposer had a positive incentive for trying to have the offer rejected, suggesting that Responders were willing to suffer relative disadvantage to their third partner in order to prevent the Proposer benefiting from a bad-faith offer. However, when the Proposer had no incentive ($0) to have their offer rejected, Responders reacted more in line with inequality aversion - again rejecting unequal offers, leaving nothing for both themselves and their third partner, who had no role in the unequal offer. -->

<!--# not attributable to produced by the members of dyads of interest. -->

<!--# Bereby-Meyer & Niederle (2005) - Using Kagel and WOlfe (2001) extension. Proposer offers split between Y/Z, and gets some amoung of payoff (0,5,10) if rejected. Responders accept small splits when responder has positie incentive, but rejects small offers when responder has no incentive - INEQUALITY AVERSION EMERGES TOWARDS DUMMY -->

<!--# The Dictator game was designed to test whether Ultimatum offers were in response to these strategic concerns, or simply due to Proposer's taste for fairness. The typical result of the Dictator game supports this strategic approach where participants cannot reject a proposed split, modal offers drop from 50% to 0% of the available wealth [@forsythe1994]. -->

<!--# In fact, the credible threat of others' inequity aversion has been argued to have a major role in the development in humans' taste of fairness -->

## Envy avoidance

People seem to be wary of being envied. Data from small-scale preindustrial societies suggests that many individuals hold "evil eye beliefs," superstitions that a mere envious glance can cause real, material harm. These beliefs are most prevalent in societies with high wealth inequality, and especially where one's resources are easily visible and vulnerable to third parties [@gershman2015]. Such patterns of envy avoidance seem adaptive when considering the risk- and conflict- inducing effects of inequality. If envious peers are more likely to be hostile and take risks, it may be helpful to anticipate when one's neighbors will feel relatively deprived, and to protect oneself from spiteful or desperate behaviours [@gershman2014; @brams2005].

<!-- The argument that tastes for fairness are consistent with approximate self-interest has been attributed to the strategic role of emotions in social life. Frank (1988) posits that -->

Likewise, a major feature of scandinavian culture is the "Jante Law" (or Janteloven/Jantelagen), which explicitly discourages individual superiority, ambition, and nonconformity. [e.g., "You musn't think you are anything special;" @sandemose1936]. Anglo-Saxon societies refer to the 'cutting down' of 'tall poppies', and in Asian cultures, 'the nail that stands out gets hammered down.'

Like Gershman, we argue that these envy avoidance norms have propagated as heuristics to help individuals anticipate the possibility of harmful behaviours arising from peers' envy. ----- propogated as a "useful rule of thumb approximating rational envy-avoidance behavior under conditions in which destructive envy is a real threat" [@gershman2015; p.120].

### THE CREDIBLE THREAT OF EMOTIONS

These patterns of envy aversion seem adaptive when considering the risk- and conflict- inducing effects of inequality. In fact, some existing theories already been proposed predicting a "fear-of-envy" equilibrium, where concerns over partner's destructive envy can reduce people's likelihood to engage in wealth-creating behaviours [@gershman2014; @brams2005].

One of the proposed roles of human emotion is to help communicate and coordinate behaviours between social actors. Since emotions predispose individuals to certain actions [e.g., @smith1990; @sznycer2021], emotions such as jealousy, anger, and envy can serve as psychological commitment devices, steering decision-makers away from dispassionate assessments of alternatives [@frank1988]. Sometimes, these mental biases can be a strategic benefit in social interactions.

The human propensity for emotional reactions in the face of inequities create a credible threat: "if I am worse off, I will get angry and make life worse for you." In anticipation of such emotional and antagonistic reactions, proposers are better off by anticipating and accommodating the responder's preference for equality. Indeed, authors have suggested that our human sense of fairness evolved as a response to the threats of inequity aversion and spiteful behaviours [@brosnan2014; @forber2014; @frank1988].

## Envy Anticipation Hypothesis

This project seeks to test an envy-anticipation theory of distrust, which generally predicts that *inequality reduces trust towards worse-off individuals among a reference group*. The hypothesized mechanism for this theory is that individuals expect envy from disadvantaged partners, and that these individuals consequently make efforts to protect themselves against the possibility of peers' hostile or risky behaviours. This envy-anticipation theory of distrust makes similar directional predictions as some existing inequality-distrust theories, but makes these predictions under more generalized circumstances. Even in the absence of absolute poverty, observations of antisocial behaviour, changes in intergroup contact, larger material incentives for antisocial behaviour, or different opportunity costs, this model would still predict that inequality increases distrust and security consumption, out of the person's efforts to protect themselves against envious reactions.

<!--# A payoff-maximizing actor will often obtain worse outcomes by neglecting the emotional reactions and "irrational" preferences of their social partners.

<!-- with commitment problems [@frank1988]. Over the lifespan of these exchanges, agents often encounter opportunities to secretly benefit themselves, at the cost of their partners. -->

<!-- Given the observed relationship between inequality and risk-taking and conflict, consumers’ implicit or explicit anticipation of others’ reactions to inequality may influence their own purchasing behaviour. Shaw et al. (2014) found that children would rather throw a resource in the trash than distribute it unequally, suggesting that concerns over equity are deeply ingrained from an early age. Given that interpersonal security products are specifically designed to deter antagonistic social partners, the proposition follows that 1) when inequality increases (whether in income or wealth), individuals will spend more on security goods. -->

<!--# The relative state model [@mishra2017] posits that individuals take risks not only to escape material destitution, but also to keep up with competitors. As a result, risk-taking can be influenced by social comparisons. As wealth distributions become more skewed, so do comparison standards. Under conditions of inequality, individuals set more ambitious goals, and subsequently take more risks, as they try to close the gap between their current state and their aspiration levels[@payne2017]. Likewise, being worse off than others can lead to emotional responses of envy and personal relative deprivation, which can be linked to gambling as well as spiteful behaviours [@callan2008; @wobker2015].  -->

## Methods

### Sample characteristics

Participants will be recruited through the crowdsourcing platform Prolific Academic. Sampled participants will be filtered for fluency in English, participation through computer (vs. smartphone/tablet), balanced for an equal gender representation, and only eligible if they have not completed an earlier experiment in this series. After data collection, participants will be screened based on an attention check and one item testing their task comprehension. After data collection, participants will be excluded from analyses unless they pass the attention and comprehension check items. Participants will also be excluded if they have erroneous or missing data for any of the model-relevant measures.

The Prolific-recruited participants will complete the studies on oTree [@chen2016], an open-source platform for conducting single- and multi-player experiments and surveys. oTree studies are written largely in html, python, and javascript, which can be saved and shared in their raw code form, allowing for extensive sharing, reproduction, and customization of protocols.

### Experimental procedures

The experiments across both Chapters 1 and 2 will be conducted in the context of a two-player economic game, called the security game[@tambe2011]. At its base form, the game is one-shot, extensive-form, and conducted with complete information. In this modification of the security game, participants are (supposedly) paired with an anonymous partner, with each being given an endowment of funds (e.g., \$2 each). Then, participants are told that their partner will have the opportunity to try to steal money from them (e.g., \$1 at a 50% chance of success, with failed thievery attempts instead making the partner lose \$1). After learning this information, participants can spend some of their money on security products (e.g., \$0.02 per unit), with each unit of security visibly reducing the probability of a successful thievery attempt (1% reduction per unit).

#### The Security Game

As a more formal summary of the procedure: After receiving initial incomes ($x_D$ = Defender's income, $x_A$ = Attacker's income), the Defender will be told that the Attacker will have the option to attempt to steal (*q*: 1 = steal, 0 = do not steal) amount $s$ (0 \< $s$ $\le$ $x_D$) from the Defender with a base probability of $p_g$ (*g* : successful thievery, 0 \< $p_g$ \< 1). However, if the Attacker has an unsuccessful thievery attempt (with probability = 1 -- $p_g$), they will lose the amount *k* (0 \< *k* $\le$ $x_A$). After learning this information, the Defender will have the option to purchase *z* units of security; each unit of security costs *m* (0 \< *m*), and reduces the probability of a successful thievery attempt by $p_z$ (0 \< $p_z$ \< 1). See Table \@ref(tab:gloss-table) for glossary of terms for this game. The expected value functions for the Defender (Equation \eqref{eq:defender-ev}) and Attacker (Equation \eqref{eq:attacker-ev}) can be expressed as:

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  \pi_D &= x_D - zm - q\{s(p_g - zp_z)\}

In written terms, Attackers will seek to maximize their payoff through the combination of their initial endowment and the expected payoff of their decision to attempt an attack. Their ability to profit from an attack is determined by the base probability of attacks being successful, which may be reduced by the amount of security purchased by the Defender. Likewise, Attackers lose from unsuccessful attempts. In sum, Attackers will choose to attempt an attack when the attack's expected value exceeds the payoff of not attacking.

Constrained by their budget, an expected value-maximizing Defender then seeks to the optimal combination of their initial endowment, the price spent on security, and the expected loss of being targeted by the Attacker. As such, expensive security products need to be accompanied with substantial reductions in an attack's success rate in order to be worth the investment.

Critically, expected cost of being attacked is weighted by the probability of the attacker making the attempt (Equation \@ref(eq:att-max)). A Defender is generally worse off if they consume some security, but not enough to make an attack unprofitable. This formulation thus emphasizes (and assumes) that security measures can be a credible deterrent, where security consumption reduces the Attackers' likelihood of successfully stealing. Given that the Attacker's decision to attack should be heavily influenced by the effort's probability of success, visible security consumption reduces the probability of an attack being attempted.

The security game experiments will take place across four studies, split across Chapters 1 and 2, testing the effects of inequality on security consumption (Study 1a), with real monetary payoffs (1b). The last two experiments (in Chapter 2) will assess the effects of inequality when endowments are due to one's own efforts (versus random; 2a), and whether apparent group-based discrimination increases security consumption under constant of inequality (2b). Except for Study 2b, for each study, inequality will be randomly assigned as a between-subjects condition.

Economic games examining self-protection are not new. Most notably, McEvily[@mcevily2012] devised a behavioural distrust game, and found that participants are very willing to pay money to guarantee that their partner splits a surplus income equally. Compared to the distrust game, the security game is explicitly probabilistic; partners have a risky choice to try stealing funds for themselves, and security expenditures reduce the probability of successful "attacks." The risky nature of the security game is particularly useful for this project because the targeted theory of envy avoidance focuses on the anticipation of increased risk-taking.

### Pilot data (Study 1)

A within-subjects pretest with an initial sample of `r pretest_initial_n` crowdsourced (Prolific) participants was conducted to calibrate the price of security (\$0.02 vs. \$0.04) and the baseline likelihood of successful thefts (50%, 60%, 75%). The pretest had two attention checks and implemented a relaxed comprehension check (selecting one of two options out of five), as only `r round(screened_n_min/pretest_initial_n*100,0)`% of participants correctly answered a single-item comprehension check, leaving n = `r screened_n` retained participants. As described in the procedure above, participants were told they would be paired with a hypothetical partner, and each would be given \$2. Then, participants were told that this partner would have the opportunity to steal \$1 from them, at a baseline chance of success, with unsuccessful thefts instead making the partner lose \$1. Then, participants were asked to indicate how much of a security product they would like to purchase, with each unit of the product costing money, and reducing the likelihood of a successful theft by 1%.

A 2w\*3w within-subjects ANOVA failed to detect significant effects of baseline likelihood of successful thefts, `r anova_extract(pretest_anova,"prob")`, nor security price, `r anova_extract(pretest_anova,"cost")`; see Figure \@ref(fig:pretest-splitplot) and Table \@ref(tab:pretest-anova)). This project will use a baseline 50% chance of successful thefts, and each unit of security costing \$0.02 (or proportional equivalent). This condition seems to produce the lowest means and the least skewed data, at `r round(base_skew,2)` (vs. skew = `r round(skew_groups["75_02"],2)` when probability is 75% and price \$0.02).

### Measurement and variables (Study 1)

Throughout these experiments, participants will be asked to choose how many units of a security product they wish to consume, ranging from 0 to 50. For the purposes of analysis and interpretation, security spending will serve as the final dependent variable where possible. Security spending will be computed by multiplying the number of security units consumed by the good's per-unit cost. Before participants make their security decision, they will be asked a battery of self-report questions about the game. For example, before their security decision, participants will be rate their agreement with the statements, "my partner is probably going to try stealing from me", and "my partner probably feels jealous of me."

Given the constraints on the minimum and maximum values for the variables in the experimental designs, outliers are considered legitimate values and will not be deleted. Instead, influential observations will be winzorized at the dependent variable to the 5th and 95th percentile values. Influential observations will be flagged as having cook's distance values exceeding the threshold 4/n; where n = \# of observations.

### Study 1a: Inequality and security spending

The first experiment will use a mixed (2b\*2w) design in a hypothetical context, manipulating economic inequality (yes vs. no) between-subjects, and stake size (\$2 vs. \$300) within-subjects, to test whether **H1)** `r tolower(hypotheses[1])` (Table \@ref(tab:design-table)), versus **H1~0~)** no significant effect of inequality. Participants will be asked to imagine that they are paired with another participant, where they will each be assigned to different roles (Blue or Yellow), and endowed with money. In the equal condition, participants will be told that their partner received the same amount of funds as themselves (e.g., \$2). In the unequal condition, participants will be told that their partner instead received only half their endowment (e.g. \$1).

Before participants make their security decisions, they will be asked four questions on whether they think their partner would be envious of them (e.g., "My partner probably feels envious of me"). Contingent on sufficient internal consistency (Cronbach's $\alpha$ $\ge$ .7), these items will be summed and used to test whether **H2)** `r hyp2_min[1]` versus **H2~0~)** no significant indirect effect of inequality on security consumption through anticipated partner envy. This procedure has a notable strength by controlling the participant's income across levels of inequality (as the partner's money is the only income that changes). Since stake size will be manipulated within-subjects, two sets of responses for game-related self-report items and security consumption decisions will be analyzed using a mixed ANOVA model and mediation analyses.

#### A priori power analysis (Study 1a)

Using mean and standard deviation values of security expenditure from the pretest (*M*=`r round(base_mean,2)`, *SD*=`r round(base_sd,2)`), an a priori power analysis has been conducted using r package SuperPower [@lakens2021] (see Figures \@ref(fig:mixed-design) and \@ref(fig:powerplot2) and and Tables \@ref(tab:2b2w-anova-exact) and \@ref(tab:2b2w-pairwise-power)). Given the unknown size of the hypothesized effect, this study will target an effect size of cohen's f = `r round(security_exact_5$main_results$cohen_f[1],2)`, which corresponds to a pattern of means yielding a cohen's d = .2 in an independent-samples t-test; a small effect according to statistical convention[@cohen1988]. To achieve 95% power with one tail, studies must have a minimum of n = `r round(cell_n_5,0)` participants per between-subjects cell, or a study-wide total of n = `r format(round(cell_n_5*2,0),big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)`.

### Study 1b: Inequality with real payoffs

The use of hypothetical scenarios in Study 1a may limit the generalizability of any results. For instance, compared to hypothetical rewards, participants take fewer risks when incentivized by real payoffs and experiencing negative feedback.[@xu2016; @hertwig2001] Study 1b will serve to replicate Study 1a, with the sole difference being that **H1)** and **H1a)** are being tested when participants believe they are playing with a real partner, and that their decision could have real payoffs. Specifically, participants will be entered in a lottery where three participants will be selected to receive the payoff from one of their decisions.

This study will also use a mixed (2b\*2w) experimental design, manipulating inequality (yes vs. no) between-subjects, and the starting probabilities of successful thefts (50% vs. 60%) within-subjects. All conditions will have a stake size of \$300 (\$3 security cost and \$150 gains/losses from thefts). Study 1b will determine its targeted sample size by seeking 95% a priori for the observed main effect of inequality in Study 1a. If Study 1a fails to find a significant effect of inequality, Study 1b will again target an effect size of cohen's f = `r round(security_exact_5$main_results$cohen_f[1],2)` (n=`r format(round(cell_n_5*2,0),big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)`). Results will be analyzed using a mixed ANOVA and mediation analyses.
