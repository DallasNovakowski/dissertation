# Effects of Fairness on Security Consumption {#ineq-fair}

Inequality has been a persistent topic in public and scientific dialogue because it is fundamental to describing whether valued resources are being shared or monopolized. Distributional fairness has likewise proven to be inextricable from inequality, since it captures the various rules defining how resources *should* (or should not) be shared. Since Chapter 1 focuses on the main effects of inequality on security consumption, this chapter seeks to examine whether distributional fairness intersects with inequality to impact distrust in populations, and consequently individuals' willingness to consume security products.

Behavioural economists have found that in both Ultimatum and Dictator games, participants that earned an advantaged position (versus random assignment) make less generous offers to their fellow participants (Hoffman, McCabe, Shachat, & Smith, 1994). Similarly, van de Ven et al. (2010) found that under conditions of inequality, those who are better off are more likely to engage in helping behaviours when they believe that their disadvantaged partner is frustrated by the disparity and harboring antagonistic motivations (i.e., "malicious envy" Crusius & Lange, 2014). By contrast, "winners" are actually less likely to help if they believe that the observed disparity has motivated their partner to improve themselves (i.e., the partner experiences "benign envy").

Together, these results suggest that perceived deservingness or fairness may play a role in individuals' willingness to consume security goods. Importantly, a growing body of evidence suggests that the roots of fairness lie in the avoidance of favoritism (Choshen-Hillel, Shaw, & Caruso, 2018; Shaw, 2013, 2017; Shaw et al., 2014; Shaw & Olson, 2012). As such, any mechanism allowing for impartial distribution of resources (e.g., a coin flip), ostensibly satisfies the need to justify a privileged position, and may reduce the felt need to consume security products.

The presence of multiple potential norms for guiding resource allocation inevitably leads to disagreements over what constitutes a fair allocation. Such potential for norm conflict is seen in cross-cultural variations in Proposer and Responder behaviours in the Ultimatum Game (Henrich et al., 2005); participants frequently exhibited seemingly aberrant patterns, such as offering more than 50% of the wealth, or rejecting offers above 50%. Particularly amongst societies with little market participation, groups appear to adhere to locally-developed norms of fairness.

Acts of partiality often signify the formation of alliances, which inherently exclude others (DeScioli & Kurzban, 2009). Since substantial interpersonal and intergroup conflict is rooted in the perception of unfairness and discrimination (Tajfel & Turner, 1979), it is thus important to understand how fairness influences willingness to consume security goods.

This envy-avoidance theory of distrust also considers the role of fairness in shaping individuals' experiences of envy, which can vary in their underlying attributions and motivations. For instance, benign envy is associated with a motivation to improve oneself, and occurs when the person believes that the envied person's advantage is deserved. By contrast, malicious envy is characterized by a desire to harm the comparison target, and is elicited when the individual believes that their environment is unfair [@vandeven2012]. When participants believe that their partner is experiencing malicious envy, they are more likely to engage in helping behaviours [@vandeven2010]. In contrast, participants who earned an advantaged position (which is associated with benign envy) tend to be less generous [@hoffman1994]. Together, the existing research suggests that people are not just sensitive to inequality and fairness, but that their decision-making also considers and anticipates others' psychological reactions to disparities.

To this end, Study 2 will examine whether merit-based and apparently group-based allocations of wealth impact security spending in the context of inequality.

under a state of inequality, group membership and agentic distributions of wealth have main and interacting effects on security consumption.

## Merit as a fairness norm

When evaluating fair distributions, the best rule is one that everyone implements. In at least amongst western industrialized societies, fairness norms appear to be heavily influenced by meritocratic concerns. In a sample of Norwegian children (grades 5 to 13), Almås, Cappelen, Sørensen, and Tungodden (2010) found that younger participants were strict egalitarians (averse to any inequality). However, as the participants got older, they increasingly accepted inequality when the disparities came from differences in production. While inequality may be an important antecedent to conflict, Study 2a will test whether a meritocratic distribution of wealth will attenuate inequality's effect on security consumption.

Meritocracy, a commonly-invoked norm of fairness in westernized and industrialized cultures, may play an important role in influencing individuals' perceived need to consume security goods. Namely, those that are wealthy may feel less threatened by their neighbors because they earned their resources "fair and square," according to a shared set of rules. However, in social settings, truly objective assessments of merit are often unavailable or are underused.

## Methods

### A priori power analysis

Given the unknown size of the hypothesized inequality\*merit interaction, this study targeted an effect size of cohen's f = .1. To achieve 95% power, studies must have a minimum of `r cell_n_2b2b_f01` participants per cell, or a study-wide total of n=`r format(cell_n_2b2b_f01*4,big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)`. This large sample size is necessary given the possibility of a "no-way" interaction, where only one condition is significantly different from the remaining conditions.[@simonsohn2015] In a no-way interaction, the simple effect of inequality is nullified depending on the moderator, and thus requires at least twice as many subjects per cell to achieve as much power as the simple effect. Figures \@ref(fig:2b2b-design) and \@ref(fig:2b2b-powerplot) display the pattern of means and per-condition sample size thresholds to obtain 95% power. Additionally, see Tables \@ref(tab:2b2b-anova-power) and \@ref(tab:2b2b-pairwise-power) for the power and effect sizes of the ANOVA and pairwise comparisons, respectively.

### Study 2a: Meritocracy and Inequality

Groups will always be characterized by inequality through some type of currency, whether wealth, income, or status. Indeed, a popular idea is that inequality propels individuals towards productive behaviours.[@stearns1999] In this line of reasoning, the presence of inequality may be less of an issue compared to how the inequality was produced. The next experiment will test whether **H3)** `r tolower(hypotheses[2])` (Table \@ref(tab:design-table); versus **H3~0~)** no significant inequality\*merit interaction). As planned comparisons, Study 1c will examine whether **H3a)** hi-inequality/random income condition will have significantly higher rates of security consumption than all other conditions (i.e., **.1)** hi-inequality/merit income, **.2)** no-inequality/random income, & **.3)** no-inequality/merit income. Study 1c again varies inequality (yes vs. no) as the previous studies, but also manipulates whether one's income is seemingly allocated *randomly or based on task performance* (random vs. merit).

For this random vs. merit manipulation, all participants will complete a slider task, where they have one minute to correctly place 40 sliders at the midpoint of various lines that appear on their screens. Participants will then either be told that their incomes were allocated randomly, or because they correctly placed more sliders than their partner. The slider task has been used in several studies to examine the effects of effort in distributional preferences, and has demonstrated that individuals that win their income through performance are less likely to support redistribution of effort-driven income allocations [@cassar2019].

As a manipulation check, before making their consumption decision, participants will be asked to report whether they believed the incomes were disbursed fairly (e.g.,"The way incomes were given for this game is fair"). Participants will be excluded from analyses if they complete fewer than 3 sliders, which would both indicate low engagement in the study and likely undermine the credibility of the manipulation. Results will be analyzed using a 2b\*2b between-subjects ANOVA.

### Study 2b: Inequality as a Product of Group-Based Discrimination

Fairness appears to have its roots in avoiding perceptions of partiality. For instance, young children will discard a resource in order to avoid sharing it unequally.[@shaw2012] Since Study 1c directly compares meritocratic versus random allocation of resources, it does not answer the more fundamental question: do people become distrustful and consume more security goods when inequality appears to be more discriminatory and unfair? Study 1d will keep a constant presence of inequality, but manipulate whether the partner is a member of an ingroup or outgroup, and whether the incomes are distributed randomly, or by a separate *ingroup individual*. Study 1d will use a 2b\*2b between subjects ANOVA to test whether **H4)** `r tolower(hypotheses[3])` (versus **H4~0~)** no significant outgroup\*agentic-distribution interaction). As planned comparisons, Study 1d will examine whether **H4a)** the outgroup partner/agentic-distribution condition will have significantly higher rates of security consumption than all other conditions (i.e., **.1)** outgroup/random, **.2)** ingroup/agentic, & **.3)** ingroup/random). Participants will complete the same fairness manipulation check as and be powered for the same effect as in Study 1c.
