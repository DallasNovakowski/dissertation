# Nation-Level Inequality and Individual-Level Security Consumption {#nat-ineq}

Security consumption is a particularly interesting phenomenon because it often reflects an individual-level effort to address a collective problem. A consumer's efforts to improve security generally attempt to decouple oneself from the shared risks of victimization. These consumption decisions allow individuals to tailor their protection to their unique perceived need, but they may also introduce inefficiencies into the collective pursuit of security.

For instance, in some cases, security consumption is clearly an overreaction to perceived threats. Consider the case of building high walls around one's home, as seen extensively in high-inequality regions such as South Africa. Paradoxically, costly fortifications can actually increase the vulnerability of one's home and community, as reduced visibility within the neighborhood allows for criminals to enter properties without detection [@marks2015]. This chapter seeks to elaborate on the collective (nation-level) effects of inequality on individual-level security consumption.

The highly-controlled nature of the experiments in Chapters 1 and 2 allow for precise tests of the hypothesized inequality-security consumption relationship. Although one experiment offered real consequences for participants' choices, economic games are highly artificial by design. Insights generated from the security game might not generalize to consumers' daily consumption context. To provide a test of the envy anticipation model with greater external validity, this project supplements these previous experimental results with a multilevel analysis of archival data on respondents' use of security products, to test whether **H5)** `r tolower(hypotheses[4])` (versus **H5~0~)** no significant effect of nation-level inequality). A significant relationship between nation-level inequality and individual security measures does not serve as an an exhaustive test of the envy anticipation hypothesis; a positive effect would likewise be expected under the other models of inequality-distrust discussed in Chapter 1 (social barriers, social inferences, resource conflict, opportunity cost, psychosocial effect). As such, the earlier experiments and this multilevel analysis shall serve as complements to each other, testing the envy anticipation model of distrust with high internal and external validity, respectively.

Just as a multilevel analysis examines the effects of inequality on security measures beyond a tightly-controlled experiment, it is also important to consider how individual's psychological and behavioural responses to the threat of crime manifest in their day-to-day lives. Individuals' experiences of crime, and their efforts to protect themselves against it, have been extensive subjects of study in subfields of sociology: criminology and victimology. Perhaps one of the most striking findings from these inquiries is that people's perception of crime rates, as well as their fear of crime, have tended to remain high despite objective crime rate estimates dropping (Figure \@ref(fig:crime-trends)).

Official crime estimates declined in the U.S. between 1980 and 2013 (for instance, recorded homicides dropping from 20,000 cases in 1980 to 12,000 in 2013). However, during this same period, surveyed perceptions and fear of crime remained essentially the same; in 1980, 37% of respondents reported a perceived in increase in crime since the last year, in 2013, 41% reported an increase [reviewed in @rader2017]. This gap between real and perceived crime rates suggests that people's thinking on crime emerges from something more than simply reacting to observed criminality. These perceptions of crime seem to have a meaningful impact on people's attitudes and behaviours. @forde1993 examined survey data throughout the 80s and 90s in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and found that individuals who perceived crime as increasing generally reported feeling less safe, and had generally negative attitudes towards walking alone at nighttime.

Borrowing from methods used in sociology, a multilevel analysis allows for participants to be compared both as individuals, as well as members of higher-level groups (e.g., countries, neighborhoods). Similarly, a multilevel analysis of survey data allows for the assessment of community members' real-life experiences, instead of the fabricated circumstances and measures used in experimental designs. Accordingly, it is important to consider the macro (societal), meso (group), and and micro (individual) factors that lead to the adoption of security measures.

<!-- [@cohen2004] Survey of -->

<!-- > U.S residents, we found that the typical household would be willing to pay between \$100 and \$150 per year for programs that reduced specific crimes by 10 percent in their communities. -->

<!-- ### The Threat of Vicimization -->

<!-- Although no unifying theory has been offered for how people think about crime, for the purposes of this study, an informative perspective may lie in the "threat of victimization" model proposed by @rader2004. In this model, security measures are treated as only one type of response to manage (or indicator of) a higher-order "threat of victimization." In addition to this behavioural response, they employ cognitive (perceived victimization risk) and emotional responses (fear of crime). This 'indicator-style' treatment of security measures is fairly common within the victimization literature [e.g., @san-juan2012], and reflects a tautology in how security measures are treated: does fear cause a person to adopt security measures, or is a security measure merely a fearful behaviour? This potential for circular reasoning creates some theoretically-uninformative explanations: "Q: why did Dallas engage in a fearful behaviour? A: Because he was afraid. Q: how did we know he was afraid? A: because he engaged in fearful behaviours. -->

### Micro predictors of fear and security

Some of the most obvious documented predictors of security measures are individuals' experiences and fears of criminal victimization [@san-juan2012; @weinstein1989; @barnes1994; @frieze1987; @smith1988; @myersjr1998]. For instance, @guedes2018 found that perceived victimization risk is associated with fear of crime (*r* = .49), and each of these psychological phenomena are associated with the adoption of security behaviours (*r*s = .22, .23, respectively). Moreover, the relationship between victimization and security measures is mediated by increased fear of crime and perceived risk of victimization [@giblin2012]. This pathway of victimization to security measures is predicted by @ferraro1995's risk interpretation model, which posits that individuals' perceived need to protect themselves from their environment is informed by their own personal experiences. Similarly, experiencing more severe crimes leads to greater adoption of security measures, which has also been found to be mediated by distress, perceived victimization risk, and fear of crime [@chadee2020].

Other studies document positive relationships between fear of crime and perceived victimization risk [@lagrange1992; @ortega1987; @reid1998], and more have linked fear of crime to greater security measures [@jackson2010; @riger1982; @williams1994; @keane1998; @mesch1998; @ortega1987; @reid1998; @rountree1996]. @kleck2011 found that perceived risk of criminal victimization, <!--# even after controlling for past criminal victimization experiences,  --> increases gun purchasing intentions amongst non-owners (and increases the likelihood of owning a gun for defensive reasons). Although there are notable variations in some of these results [e.g., a stronger relationship between fear of crime and household (vs. personal) security measures, @mesch1998], the general consensus is that these victimization variables are positively associated with one another.

Fear of crime, and security measures by extension, have been of substantial interest to researchers, seeming to act as a "sponge" that also expresses vague social concerns, disconnected from any real threat of victimization [@jackson2004]. @taylor1986 summarized three models of how fear of crime originates: 1) indirect victimization, with those more likely to be exposed to crime information, and/or those least able to cope with criminal attempts, 2) perceived disorder, caused by increased exposure to 'incivilities', and 3) community concern, with an interaction of increasing crime and lack of structural ties causing increased concerns and fear.

<!-- The threat of victimization model is particularly useful because it explicitly predicts positive and reciprocal relationships between security measures, perceived victimization risk, and fear of crime. This specification is consistent with evidence from cross-sectional studies.  -->

<!-- Some studies show a positive relationship between fear of crime and the ownership and carrying of firearms for protection (Bankston et al., 1990, Smith and Uchida, 1988). -->

Since the majority of studies in victimology are cross-sectional, there has been limited ability to assess the causal order of the the relationships between fear of crime, security measures, and perceived victimization risk. However, some evidence combining archival individual victimization data and simultaneous equation techniques points to a reciprocal and reinforcing relationship between people's fear of crime, perceived risk, and their adopted security measures. @liska1988 found that 'constrained behaviors' and fear of crime were reciprocal, with a feedback loop occurring between these two variables. They claimed these behaviours constrain "social behavior and thus results in avoiding such situations, which in turn accentuates fear" (p. 835) [see also @ferraro1995; @rountree1998a; @smith1997]. Similarly, @rader2004 suggests, "it may be the case that people remain afraid even after buying a security system because the security system is a constant reminder of the potential threat of victimization that might occur if they do not continue to engage in such behaviors" (p. 699-700). These results should be discouraging for potential consumers of security products; they may actually feel less safe after their purchases.

Other authors have highlighted some important distinctions between fear of crimes against property versus crimes against persons. In an survey of Israeli community members, @mesch1998 found that fear of crime was more often reported for one's family than for oneself. They also found that protective measures were more likely to be adopted for property offenses than personal crimes. Likewise, only the fear of burglary significantly affected the likelihood of household protective action, and in a full regression, fear of sexual assault, fear of being home at night, fear of family being assaulted, and fear of family being sexual assaulted, were all predictive of personal security measures. Thus, these extra considerations in the conceptualization of ear of crime do indeed to improve the concept's ability to predict the adoption of security measures.

<!-- #### Fear of crime -->

<!-- Although fear of crime and perceived victimization risk are not the focus of this study, it seems important to clarify what these concepts mean, particularly in relation to security measures. Parallel to the notions of "cold" and "hot" cognition, perceived victimization risk refers to one's perceived likelihood of being a victim to crime ("e.g., *How safe would you feel being home alone?*"), whereas fear of crime best captures a offense-specific and emotion-laden worry of being victimized *(e.g., "how worried are you about the crime of rape happening in your neighborhood?*" [reviewed in @rader2017] <!--# Ferraro, 1995; Ferraro & Lagrange, 1998) -->

<!-- Each of these reactions are posited to manifest at the collective (aka vicarious; e.g., family) and personal levels, generally requiring specific measures tailored to these targets [@ferraro1987; Skogan and Maxfield, 1981; Warr, 1992; Fishman and Mesch, 1996]. -->

<!--# fear of crime is more than just fear of crime, but equally functions as an easy accessible discourse to express more fundamental and abstract feelings of social uncertainties (Hollway and Jefferson 1997, Walklate and Mythen 2008). Hence, fear of crime can also be seen as an 'umbrella sentiment' that expresses socio-economic insecurities rather than actual crime-related insecurities (Vieno et al., 2013). -->

<!--# vulnerability hypothesis (see, for example, Pain, 2000) "A great deal of individual-level research has indeed corroborated that fear of crime is detrimental to people's subjective well-being (for example, Cohen, 2008; Hanslmaier, 2013; Lane et al., 2014; Michalos and Zumbo, 2000; Moore, 2006)."  -->

<!--# victimization to fear of crime and risk perception @myersjr1998 @parker1993 @reid1998 @rountree1996 @smith1991 "Our rationale for why this is the case relates to how we think potential criminals and their victims will be affected by extreme income discrepancies. Local elites interpreting inequality as a reason to invest in private security may introduce non-linearity into the relationship, for example (Bourguignon, 2000)" -->

<!--# Security measures are a natural response to anticipated, as well as experienced, crime victimzation. -->

### Meso predictors of fear and security

Meso systems are probably the most flexible 'level' of society to define. Meso could by used to describe group of individuals playing pick-up sports, a neighborhood, or a powerful multi-national corporation. Perhaps surprisingly then, meso-level predictors of security measures seem to have been scarcely studied. For instance, @san-juan2010 examined a city in northern Spain, and found that residential districts had significantly different adoption rates of security measures. However, they did not carry out any other analyses to further examine the source of the variation (which is probably for the best since they only examined eight districts). @smith1988 analyzed some aggregated neighborhood-level data (but without a multilevel model), and found that individuals in some areas were more likely to have security measures, for instance, those neighborhoods with more single-parent households. Those few meso level studies generally have substantial limitations, likely due to the difficulty of surveying a sufficient number of meso-level and individual-level units. A good example of a meso-level study examined fear of crime. In a study across 5,196 british neighborhoods and 102,133 individuals, @brunton-smith2011 found a number of regional predictors of fear of crime: greater economic disadvantage, urbanization, younger population, housing supply, ethnic heterogeneity, local crime, and disorder. Additionally, they found that individual predictors included being: female, younger, uneducated, nonwhite, a newspaper reader, crime victim, not married, ill, and a long-time resident. While Study 3 will only examine micro- and macro-level predictors of security, there is defnitely predictive value to incorporating predictors at the intermediate meso level/

<!--# "Traditionally, these context variables are located at the mesolevel by describing the neighbourhood and community characteristics in which individuals live (for a recent review, see Lorenc et al., 2014)." -->

### Macro predictors of fear and security

Lastly, macro-level factors reflect the largest-scale influences in a country. These can range from economic, cultural, legal, political, and ecological factors. Using the European Social Survey, @vauclair2017 found that individuals in more unequal countries reported a greater fear of crime. The authors also report that income inequality's effect on fear of crime is strongest among ethnic *majority* members. This inequality\*ingroup interaction was in direct contradiction to a key hypothesis in the fear of crime literature: the sense of vulnerability, which predicts that the groups most objectively vulnerable to crime [e.g., older individuals, women, minority groups\\; @hale1996] should be the most afraid. One sobering interpretation of this fear amongst majority groups is the notion of fear of crime as a "sponge," suggesting that 'people are not as "fearful" of personally being victimized as often we think; rather, they are expressing their social concerns through the symbolically dense concept of crime' [@jackson2004, p. 962]. However, this interaction effect must be interpreted with caution, as estimates of cross-level interactions are often unstable when cluster sizes are fewer than 50 [@hox2018].

Other studies provide mixed evidence of the inequality-security/fear relationship. After controlling for many country-level factors (e.g., Benefits in kind for families/children; unemployment rate; registered crimes), @hummelsheim2011 found that across 23 European countries, nation-level Gini had no incremental effect when predicting fear of crime. @corvalan2022 reports a significant relationship between nation-level inequality and aggregated "private security" measures. However, the authors do not report any methodological details for their analysis, and only report on effects at the country-level. One must be cautious in such a case to avoid the ecological fallacy, where observations and inferences of groups are erroneously applied to the group members. In this case, while an aggregate inequality-security correlation may be observed, this relationship may not persist when making predictions for individuals. Likewise, they present a model whereby inequality increases crime and security consumption, through the increased material incentives of (preventing) criminality.

<!-- Particularly when testing for an effect of envy anticipation, an analysis of the effects of inequality on security consumption should control for experiences and overall prevalence of crime victimization -->

<!-- In particular, majority groups may be using fear of crime as a way to express prejudices against minority groups [@ceobanu2011].  -->

<!-- > One of the most obvious explanations is that greater crime rates should produce greater fear of crime in the population. If individuals live in an environment that provides them with information about crime rates, they should process this information into their risk perceptions, leading to greater fear of crime (Lorenc et al., 2012). Yet one recent macro-level study using cross-national data from the European region found that registered crime rates actually had little explanatory power in explaining fear of crime (Hummelsheim et al., 2011). -->

<!-- Security consumption offers some tradeoffs in assessing consumer distrust and fear. Most notably, as a measure, self-reports of fear carry measurement error, since they include cognitive, emotional, and behavioural components (Ferraro and LaGrange, 1987; see Fattah and Sacco, 1989).  -->

<!-- The conceptual clarity of fear of crime may be muddled, consider that @vauclair2017 found that country-level fear of crime was strongly correlated with subjective well-being, r = -.67 (but Income inequality also correlates with subjective well-being at r = -.61). -->

<!--# growth rate, the unemployment rate, the urbanization rate, the female labour force participation rate and the share of males in the age group 15 to 64. (neumayer, 2005) -->

<!-- The link between inequality and crime has been the subject of extensive research and debate. For instance, inequality has been linked to higher nation-level homicide rates across countries [@daly2016], but such links to violent crimes are not seen across time points [@neumayer2005]. One compelling account for this discrepancy is that inequality's effect on conflict and criminality is moderated by the degree to which individuals compete with their local neighbors [@krupp2018]. For instance, consider scholarship competitions that are either limited to a single university department, versus those that are available for international applicants. For these smaller-scale, or "local" competitions, individuals have much more to gain by outcompeting and undermining their proximate peers; if one refuses an opportunity to study or collaborate together. -->

<!-- In this sense, inequality at a country-level represents a "global" scale of competition; a person in Alabama may be far worse off than someone in the Hamptons, but they are unlikely to compete with one another for money or status. At such a large scale, inequality has a smaller effect on individuals' willingness to engage in costly and risky conflict. Conversely, inequality has a larger effect when competition is at a smaller scale, such as within a family, neighborhood, or workplace. Together these results indicate that observations at the level of countries are likely to produce the weakest estimates of the effects of inequality. -->

<!--# Contextual effects on security vs. crime -->

<!--# What does multilevel analysis offer marketing science? Compared to other social sciences, the marketing discipline is compelling because it is comparatively contextualized, interdisciplinary, and applied. allows an assessment of contextual (e.g., societal, group-level) factors on individual outcomes. archival data sampled from community members offers contextual analysis of macro (societal) and/or group-level (meso) effects on individual outcomes. -->

<!-- Sociological inquiries into risky decision-making often invoke the notion of a "risk society," referring to society-level traditions (anxious preoccupation - "everyday culture of risk") and institutions (systems for managing hazards) that have developed in response to the unique harms introduced by modernization. Together, a risk society suggests that both people's psychology, as well as economy and governance, have drifted towards the individual-level burden of managing universal risks, which are consistent across time and space (Mythen and Walklate, 2006). -->

<!-- In a world-spanning, and constantly changing risk society, risk is said to manifest in a "generalized anxiety," which is expressed through 'discourses' (e.g., fear of crime, health promotion, home safety), that help to structure thinking, and identify threats and the means to protect oneself. In this perspective, discrete prevention activities are seen as *outlets of expression* (presumably how individuals' concerns/anxieties manifest in behaviour), in which any number of anxieties (varying in types/sources and intensities; Hunt 1999) combine with *social context* (demographics - life experience, world views), *perceived proximity to threats*, and *individual biographies* (e.g., experiential - victimization experiences; perceptions of future - e.g., general anxiety; personal coping style - thoughts and effort preparing, risk-taking) to yield protective and preventative behaviours (Krewski et al., 2008). -->

<!-- The idea or a risk society may be best captured as a 'cascade/spillway of anxiety expression,' where an society-wide, generalized anxiety spills into different, domain-specific discourses (anxieties; fear of crime, home safety, health promotion), the number and intensities of these anxieties then reach a tipping point to elicit a protective behaviour. At these different stages/outlets, social context, individual biographies, and perceived proximity to threats interact with these anxieties and each other to channel the flow of anxiety to behaviour. -->

<!-- @hollway1997 and @vanbrunschot2009 suggest that crime prevention measures (such as home safety preparedeness - **preventive and protective** behaviours) are a behavioural expression of anxiety -->

## Methods

The relationship between country-level inequality and the consumption of security products was tested in Study 3 using multilevel regressions. These analyses were accomplished using a combination of three archival datasets: the ICVS [International Crime Victimization Survey\; for individual-level measures, including security\; Van Kesteren -@vankesteren2010], the Standardized World Income Inequality Database [SWIID\; for nation inequality\; Solt, -@solt2020], and the Penn World Tables [PWT, version 10.0\; for nation GDP\; Feenstra, Inklaar, & Timmer, -@feenstra2015]. These databases were accessed as follows: ICVS, September 1, 2020; SWIID, October 21, 2020, and PWT, March 17, 2021. After a period of data exploration, cleaning, and pilot-testing, the procedure for testing **H5)** has been pre-registered (Section \@ref(s3-ap)) prior to any hypothesis-relevant analyses. Pre-registration is beneficial when analyzing archival data, as such data-dependent analysis, the so-called "garden of forking paths" [@gelman2014] allows a researcher to pick and choose those data and analyses that best suit their preferred conclusions [@simmons2011]. Hopefully, a pre-commitment to preprocessing and analysis plans before model estimation reduces these researcher degrees of freedom, and leads to the transparent selection of a more procedurally-sound model.

<!-- Atkinson and Brandolini (2001) discuss these and several related pitfalls in their excellent survey on the use of secondary data sets in studies of income inequality. -->

<!-- Second, nation-level inequality in disposable income was accessed through the SWIID [@solt2020]. The SWIID consists of 100 separate dataframes, with varying Gini values to reflect the values' uncertainty (i.e., larger standard errors) when making comparisons across different countries or time periods.  -->

<!-- Lastly, countries' expenditure-side real GDP and populations were retrieved from the PWT. The selected values were adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity, and divided by their nations' population sizes to yield a per-capita GDP value [@feenstra2015]. -->

### Data Inclusion and Exclusion

Indicators of individual security consumption and other person-level measures have been accessed from the ICVS [@vankesteren2010], which has surveyed over 300,000 people across `r cleaned_countries` different countries since 1989 on householders' experiences with crime, policing, crime prevention, and feelings of unsafety. Data screening commenced with the ICVS, to find those years and countries that had data to the research aims, particularly participants' reported usage of security measures. The ICVS has been collected across eight different sweeps (1: 1989 [13 countries], 2: 1992-1994 [29], 3: 1995-1998 [44], 4: 1999-2003 [46], 5:2004-2006 [18], 6: 2010 [6], 7: 2014 [5], 8: 2015 [1]; with an additional EU-specific sweep in 2005 [16]).

The ICVS is not a fully standardized survey, and thus varies across countries in its procedure. For instance, sampling methods include 3 stage stratified samples, random digit dialing, and random sample stratified by administrative regions. Likewise, interviews were conducted both with face-to-face and computer-assisted-telephone-interviewing.

<!-- The average duration of the European component was 23.2 minutes, face-to-face methods took 30% to 50% longer (REF??). -->

<!-- Surveying entire nations or specific cities -->

<!-- 3 stage stratified sample. -->

<!-- random sample, stratified by administrative -->

<!-- region within the city -->

<!-- Two stage random route sample -->

<!-- National random dialling of telephone numbers -->

<!-- Randomised telephone selection stratified on -->

<!-- district level -->

<!-- Stratified 2-stage sampling; A sample of 209 cities/villages, stratified by town size was taken. Within cities/villages, a random sample of individuals from the population registry -->

<!-- Stratified (by socio economic characteristic) -->

<!-- sample, age 18 and older -->

<!-- Stratified by the municipalities’ administrative -->

<!-- areas. Data from the capital city is used. -->

<!-- split samples -->

Importantly, in each of the sweeps in the ICVS, there is substantial variation in which countries are surveyed, and the questionnaires used. There have been over a dozen different questionnaires that have been implemented across the ICVS's lifespan. With so much variability, one cannot simply compute and compare variables without screening and cleaning. Otherwise, unfair comparisons will be made, such as comparing Norway in 2005 to Indonesia in 1989, with respondents in Norway not even being asked any questions on their security consumption. Some extensive screening was conducted to guide the selection of countries and time periods for analysis, to ensure the comparability of responses. Personal correspondence with an author and maintainer of the ICVS has revealed that the items used in questionnaires were screened for comparability before combination into the full dataset.

The main analysis for this study opts to combine the 2004-2006 survey sweep with the 2005 EU-specific sweep, yielding an initial count of 34 countries. These sweeps are perfectly complementary, with no countries being measured twice. Just under half of all ICVS-surveyed countries were included between 2004-2006. This 2004-2006 window offers some notable benefits: relatively recent data, a small time window encompassing each observation, and a sufficient number of level 2 clustering variables [30+ clusters are recommended for multilevel models\; Snijders & Bosker, -@snijders2011]. As will be described later, another sweep from 1999-2003 was also analyzed as part of a pre-registered robustness check for the 2004-06 results.

After selecting a time period (2004-06) and cleaning the nation-level identifiers, further screening was guided by attempting to choose the greatest number of relevant variables for analysis. For instance, Hong Kong was dropped due to complete missingness for participant age. Similarly, individual observations were dropped if they were missing responses on age, gender, or employment status. Multiple security measures are also surveyed in the ICVS. These items were screened to assess which variables would be used to construct the dependent variable of security consumption: watch dog, high fence, neighborhood watch scheme, burglar alarm, special door locks, special grills, caretaker security, and gun ownership.

Some of the data collection in the ICVS was ordered and financed by specific governments. As a result, there can be some inconsistencies in the data. For instance, the 2005 period has duplicated data for the UK, due to some separate contracting between the EU and UK governments. These duplicated data have some greater granularity, including Scotland and Northern Ireland as separate countries. Unfortunately, these smaller regions are less likely to systematically collect country-level data, particularly not collecting inequality data regularly, so are only represented at the level of the UK.

Approximately 90 participants were dropped because they reported living in an institution, so were not asked any security questions. A reporting feature in the ICVS bears mention. For binary items, such as these above prevention measures, "yes" responses are coded as a "1," whereas "no" answers are coded as missing, effectively not checking a box. As such, it leaves ambiguity as to whether a blank response is a "no," or a true missing value. Fortunately, there is an item for participants to indicate a refusal to respond, so participants were excluded if they refused response (Similarly, participants were excluded if they reported "do not know" when asked about their security measures). As an additional check, each country was screened to see whether any of them had *only* missing values for any of the measures. Switzerland had missing responses for all security items, this country and all its respondents were removed.

<!-- This screening method is not perfect. For instance, it could be true that, as the responses suggest, not a single respondent in the South Africa survey owns a gun. However, given that these surveys generally have a large sample size (1460 individuals in South Africa, minimum of 790 across 2004-2006), if participants were actually asked an item, it becomes exceedingly likely that at least one person would answer in the affirmative. As such, we will assume that complete missingness on an item across a country indicates that the question was not asked at all, and indicates truly missing data. -->

Observations were likewise excluded from the final 2004-6 dataset if they were missing on age, gender, employment status, and number of victimization experiences. After excluding for missing data on security and key independent variables, k = `r sum(summary(iv_2005$country)>0)` countries, and n = `r format(nrow(iv_2005), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)` participants were retained for primary analyses (average `r format(round(iv_2005_nper_country,0), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)` respondents per country). Those retained countries were as follows:

> `r glue::glue_collapse(x = iv_2005_countries, ", ", last = ", and the  ")`

A notable limitation to this 2004-06 ICVS data is the over-representation of WEIRD countries (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic). Other, less WEIRD, and more unequal countries (e.g., phillipines, nigeria, india) are better represented throughout sweeps 2 to 4. Further screening information can be found in the supplementary materials (Section \@ref(s3-ap)), but as a summary, this 2004-06 period provides a balance of relative data recency, larger sample size, and a larger range of values on key variables such as inequality and victimization experiences.

### Measurement and Variables

#### Outcome variable

```{r prev-var-recode, echo = FALSE}
prevention_min2 <- dplyr::recode(prevention_min2, "prev_burglar_alarm" = "burglar alarm", "prev_special_door_locks" = "special door locks", "prev_special_grills" = "window grills", "prev_high_fence" = "high perimeter fence", "prev_caretaker_security" = "presence of a caretaker who provides security")

```

A reduced group of prevention measures included burglar alarms, special door locks, special grills, high fence, caretaker security, and gun ownership. However, gun ownership was missing for South Africa, Peru, and Japan. Each of these countries are valuable in making the data more representative of non-WEIRD countries; additionally, South Africa and Peru are some of the highest-inequality countries in this dataset. Excluding these countries and restricting the range of observations for the sake of one additional security measure did not seem to be an acceptable trade-off, so gun ownership was dropped from the computation of this study's dependent variable.

Security consumption (*M* = `r round(mean(iv_2005$total_security),2)`, *SD* = `r round(sd(iv_2005$total_security),2)`) has been computed by summing respondents' self-reported ownership of `r as.english(length(prevention_min2))` different preventative measures:

> `r glue::glue_collapse(x = prevention_min2, ", ", last = ", and ")`.

This security consumption variable excludes several security items in the ICVS due to missing data, such as owning a watch dog, having surveillance arrangements with neighbors, and purchasing insurance against criminal activities.

<!-- a burglar alarm, special door locks, special grills, a high perimeter fence, and caretaker security. -->

Security consumption may hold some methodological benefits from psychological self-report measures of fear of crime and perceived victimization risk. For instance, a reported sense of fear or vulnerability may be viewed as unfavorable attitudes to report, especially for men. "Sutton and Farral (2005) even argue that, in reality, men might have a greater fear of crime than women but it is a private experience" [@san-juan2012, p. 663]. In order to avoid reporting their fear, individuals might under-report out of social desirability. By comparison, the existence of a security measure is a far more concrete, and less subjective question; rather than having to gauge a potentially uncomfortable belief or feeling, individuals just have to make a binary observation about a feature of their living space, arguably leaving less room for biased responses.

#### Predictor variables

##### Individual measures.

```{r vic-var-assault-recode, echo = FALSE}
vic_var_assault <- dplyr::recode(vic_var_assault, "cartheft_5yrs" = "car thefts", "motortheft_5yrs" = "motor vehicle thefts", "bicyctheft_5yrs" = "bicycle thefts", "burglar_5yrs" = "burglaries", "attempt_5yrs" = "attempted burglaries", "robbery_5yrs" = "robberies", "pers_theft_5yrs" = "thefts", "assault_5yrs"="physical assaults")
```

```{r vic-var-recode, echo = FALSE}
vic_var_drop <- dplyr::recode(vic_var_drop, "cartheft_5yrs" = "car thefts", 
                              # "motortheft_5yrs" = "motor vehicle thefts", 
                              "bicyctheft_5yrs" = "bicycle thefts", 
                              "burglar_5yrs" = "burglaries", 
                              "attempt_5yrs" = "attempted burglaries",
                              "robbery_5yrs" = "robberies",
                              "pers_theft_5yrs" = "thefts"
                              # , "assault_5yrs"="physical assaults"
                              )
```

Similar to security measures, self-reported crime victimization was computed as a count variable for the following items: `r glue::glue_collapse(x = vic_var_drop, ", ", last = ", and ")`, summing `r as.character(as.english(length(vic_var_drop)))` binary items on respondent's experiences of victimization. Similar to security measures, not all items appeared to have been administered in all surveys. For instance, Peru is missing responses on assaults, and Australia is missing sexual offences. Reported victimizations will be represented twice in the analyses - once as a nation-average value, and again for the individual respondent, capturing both the contextual effects of a high-crime country, and individuals' own experiences of victimization. Self-reported victimization has been suggested to be a superior way to measure a country's crime rates, as official crime statistics can face many data integrity issues, such as systematic under-reporting [@dijk2007]. For instance, @soares2004 suggests that poor countries tend to under-report crime more than rich countries. Under-reporting or under-recording might also be a problem in autocratic regimes.

Age was reported in five-year bins, ranging from 16 to 70+. Individuals were coded as employed if they reported working or being in the army, and not employed if they were "looking for work," "keeping home," "retired," "disabled," "still in school," or "other." Gender was recorded as either male or female.

<!-- > Correlations between the two measures of the levels of different types of crime among industrialised nations were stronger when victimisation rates were adjusted for reporting to the police. In other words there is closer correspondence in relative risks of crime when account is taken of differences in reporting to the police... Correlations between unadjusted victimisation rates and police figures are mostly weak and rarely statistically significant. -->

<!-- > These results confirm that levels of recorded crimes cannot be reliably used for comparing levels of common crime across countries. Crime victim surveys seem a better source of information on levels of crime across countries. -->

The targeted model sought to include predictor variables at country- and individual-levels: at the nation level, 1) nation inequality (Gini - disposable income), 2) expenditure-side GDP per capita (matched purchasing power parity), and 3) nation-level self-reported crime victimization (computed from individual measures in the ICVS). A notable preprocessing step is that Gini and GDP values were averaged across 2004-2006 into single indices, to accommodate all of the years where the survey sweeps were conducted. At the respondent level: 1) age (five-year increments), 2) gender (`r round(summary(iv_2005$gender)["female"]/nrow(iv_2005)*100,0)`% female), 3) employment status (`r round(summary(iv_2005$employed)[1]/nrow(iv_2005)*100,0)`% employed), and 4) number of individual victimization experiences. See Table \@ref(tab:s3desc-tab) for remaining descriptive statistics, and Appendix Section \@ref(s3-ap) for more detailed data cleaning and preparation procedures.

##### Income Inequality.

For any efforts to make nation-level comparisons, consistency of statistics across times and countries are a challenge. Comparing income inequality is no different. The most prevalent measure of income inequality, the Gini index, is constructed by surveying the income of sampled households in a target population, and calculating the degree of wealth dispersion (0 being complete equality, 100 being complete inequality). However, measures of household income can vary across countries and times. For instance, since Gini coefficients are calculated from households and not individuals, researchers have made different choices whether and how to adjust incomes for the number of household members (e.g., comparing a household of one person making \$100,000 to a household of two adults and three children making \$120,000). In this case, simply copying a Gini index from a second dataset with a different computation risks inaccurate comparisons with a corresponding excessive amount of confidence in the value itself. However, if a researcher only wanted perfectly comparable indices, they would be forced to throw out the majority of available Gini observations. To this end, the SWIID has been constructed in order to maximize the use of available inequality observations, while incorporating any uncomparability as measurement error.

The SWIID is based on the Luxembourg Inequality Study (LIS; AKA. LIS Cross-National Data Center), which consists of micro-level data across countries, harmonized for cross-country comparability. The LIS uses the square-root of household members in order to compare units. These LIS observations serve as baselines to compare against other Gini estimates in the same country-year. These relationships are then used to predict the value of the LIS Gini, when data from the LIS is absent, but other information is available. Together, the SWIID is made up of "15,730 Gini coefficients from 2,984 country-years in 196 countries or territories" [@solt2020, p. 5], all extracted from 384 different sources. The SWIID has been tested with 'k-fold cross-validation,' a machine-learning technique to iteratively train and test a model in predicting values in the LIS. These predicted values manifest in the SWIID as 100 separate tables of data, with varying predicted Gini values to reflect the estimate's uncertainty (i.e., larger standard errors) when making comparisons across different countries or time periods.

The SWIID offers a selection of different Gini indices, depending on how income is defined. This study will focus on 'disposable income,' representing incomes after taxes and transfers. Disposable income was selected for this project for two reasons: firstly, it is the most commonly-measured type of income reported in the sourced datasets, resulting in more precise Gini estimates; secondly, disposable income better represents a household's true purchasing power. Other definitions include 'market income' (pre-tax, pre-transfer), "'absolute redistribution' (the difference between the Ginis for market income and disposable income) and of relative redistribution (this difference divided by the Gini for market income and then multiplied by 100, that is, the percentage by which the market-income Gini is reduced)" [@solt2020, p. 13-14].

<!-- This yields nineteen categories (no observations provide information about the distribution of consumption per employee). Due to their superior quality, the two series of LIS data, which are based on household adult-equivalent net and gross income, are considered separate categories, bringing the total number of categories of data to twenty-one. -->

<!-- The LIS has meticulously harmonized its survey microdata to be as comparable cross-nationally as possible; inequality observations calculated from these harmonized microdata therefore serve as the baselines for the SWIID.18 These two LIS baselines anchor the SWIID’s estimates of market and disposable income inequality.19 -->

<!-- >Rather than a single consistent series, then, these three breaks mean the Eurostat data for France actually consist of four separate series (1994-1999, 2000-2002, 2003-2006, and 2007-2016) that are not comparable with each other. -->

<!-- > defining a series, then, as a group of one or more observations from the same country calculated using the same methodology, the resulting dataset comprises 2,616 series. -->

<!-- >The Gini is more sensitive to changes in the middle of the income distribution than some other metrics, such as the Atkinson index and the Theil indices, and unlike those measures it cannot be analytically decomposed. -->

<!-- >The general rule, however, is that data is excluded if it measures the income distribution of only urban or rural populations, or of only selected cities, or some other such incomplete territory. -->

<!-- > This requirement that the observation must not be restricted to only the employed is new; it means nearly 600 observations on the distribution of wages across employed individuals that were included in the source data of earlier versions of the SWIID are now excluded -->

<!-- > , observations for the same country in the same year, but with different welfare definitions and equivalence scales or from different sources, are important to generating the SWIID’s cross-nationally comparable estimates. -->

<!-- > because the SWIID’s inequality estimates for countries with fewer country-year observations will include more interpolated values, which in turn will have more uncertainty, andbecause estimates are not extrapolated beyond the years observed in the source data—more years without any estimates at all. -->

<!-- >There are observations for 123 countries in 2005, the year with the broadest coverage. -->

<!-- > A welfare definition is an answer to the question, this Gini measures the distribution of what? The four welfare definitions employed in the SWIID source data are market income, gross income, disposable income, and consumption. Market income is defined as the amount of money coming into the household, excluding any government cash or near-cash benefits, the so-called ‘pretax, pre-transfer’ income.11 Gross income is the sum of market income and government transfer payments; it is ‘pre-tax, post-transfer’ income.12 Disposable income, in turn, is gross income minus direct taxes: ‘post-tax, post-transfer’ income.13 Consumption does not refer to the money coming into the household at all but rather to the money going out. As can be seen in the left panel of Figure 5, in the SWIID source data, Ginis of disposable income are much more common than those using other welfare definitions. -->

<!-- disposable income still does not take into account, on the one hand, indirect taxes such as sales or value-added taxes, or, on the other, public services and indirect government transfers such as price subsidies. -->

<!-- Equivalence scales are the ways in which the size and composition of a household are incorporated into the calculation of its members’ welfare. On the one hand, these factors can simply be ignored, with all households with the same amount of income or consumption treated as if they enjoy the same level of welfare, regardless of their size. One can improve on this household ‘scale’ by dividing the household’s income by its number of members, that is, by using a per capita scale.-->

<!-- The so-called ‘OECD-modified’ scale for the number of adult equivalents (which the OECD itself actually does not use, preferring the square-root scale) counts the first adult as 1, all other adults as .5, and each child as .3 -->

<!-- If we were willing to put aside the less obvious incomparabilities across its observations and use the only data with most common combination of welfare definition and equivalence scale, disposable income per capita, we would be left with only 1766 observations, or just 11% of the total information available -->

##### GDP.

Countries' expenditure-side real GDP and populations were retrieved from the PWT. The PWT stands out because it has a long history of using price data from the International Comparisons Program to adjust GDP values to purchasing-power-matched U.S. dollars (i.e., their 'real' GDP). Expenditure-side GDP reflects the standard of living in an economy, as opposed to production-side GDP, which reflects its industry output. The selected values divided by their nations' population sizes to yield a per-capita GDP value [@feenstra2015].

### Pre-registered plan

```

The pre-registered analysis plan sought to prioritize treating security consumption as an ordinal variable (0: no security consumption, 1: one unit of security consumption, 2: two units, or 3: three or more units), using a cumulative link mixed model. The distribution of values in security consumption exhibits excessive skewness and asymmetry, and is not suitable to a linear model. Likewise, despite security consumption being a count variable of multiple binary occurrences, it is unlikely to meet the assumptions for a poisson process, which assumes that the maximum value stretches out indefinitely. Because of these limitations, treating the dependent variable as ordinal strikes a balance of model parsimony (minimizing assumptions about the variable), while leveraging information on the data's ranked structure.

Likewise, the ICVS dataset includes frequency weights for all included participants. These weights will be used whenever possible, as country-wide household surveys are unlikely to yield samples that are perfectly representative of their populations. Pilot analyses did indicate possible convergence issues when weights are included. As such, the contingency plan as depicted in Figure \@ref(fig:icvs-2004-6-cont) was proposed for the analysis. 1) Attempt weighted ordinal regression, if the weighted ordinal model fails to converge, 2) conducted the model without frequency weights, elsewise, 3) conduct a weighted mixed logistic regresssion, then 4) attempt an unweighted mixed logistic regression. In the event of logistic regressions being used, security consumption was coded as 0: no consumption, and 1: one or more units reported.

A number of variables had transformations applied to facilitate intelligible intercepts and control size of eigenvalues. The following variables were centered at their appropriate levels: age, Gini, and nation-level victimization rates. GDP was scaled to reflect the countries' z-score. A supplementary analysis was also proposed as a robustness check, to be conducted on a different sweep period of the ICVS (1999-2003), with a final sample size of n = 70,264 (not repeated from 2004-06), and k = 41 countries (starting with 56 countries and 92,943 participants). In addition to the larger number of countries, this 1999-2003 sweep also has sufficient data on respondent housing to include them in the model (apartment dwelling as reference), which is important because housing is a potential confound in the 2004-06 sweep (the dependent measure is predominantly composed of items on household security). The predictor models for this 1999-03 sweep thus consisted of:

> Nation inequality, GDP per capita, nation-level victimization rates, individual victimizations, gender, age, house (vs. apartment), shanty (vs. apartment), other house (e.g., townhouse vs. apartment), and relationship status (partnered vs. not partnered)

The 1999 sweep covers a number of additional countries outside of the typical WEIRD countries covered in the 2004-06 sweeps:

> `r glue::glue_collapse(x = setdiff(responders_1999_countries,iv_2005_countries), ", ", last = ", and  ")`

However, it is missing a number of countries that are included in the 2004-06 period

> `r glue::glue_collapse(x = setdiff(iv_2005_countries,responders_1999_countries), ", ", last = ", and  ")`

Each of the 2004-06, and 1999-3 sweeps intersect in covering the following countries:

> `r glue::glue_collapse(x = intersect(iv_2005_countries,responders_1999_countries), ", ", last = ", and  ")`

In order to test model robustness with the same variables, the pre-registration included a proposal to analyze the k = 32 data and the k = 41 data with models using a reduced model specification, only including matching variables (excluding partnered, employed, and housing; substituting Gini and GDP values for appropriate sweep periods).

<!-- > `ordered(security_winz) ~ Gini_year_cent + gdppc_year_scale + victim_nation_cent + num_victim_5yr + age_cent + male +  (1 | country)` -->

For all analyses, the coefficient estimates and standard errors were extracted through simulations. In practice, any specified regression was conducted on 100 separate dataframes; each of which was a combination of one of the SWIID iterations, and an identical PWT/ICVS combination. The distributions for fixed-effects estimates were then generated by simulation (5000 iterations) from 100 dataframes of regression results, each consisting of coefficients and variance/covariance matrices from their respective model. These fixed-effects distributions were used to calculate point estimates and standard errors for each coefficient.

## Results

Attempting to follow the pre-registered contingency plan, as presented in Figure \@ref(fig:icvs-2004-6-cont), all analyses yielded errors or warnings for at least some of the 100 analyzed datasets. Both the weighted and unweighted ordinal regressions were unable to compute standard errors for `r mw100_ord_nonconverge`/100 analyses. By contrast, each of the weighted and unweighted versions of logistic regressions successfully computed standard errors, but returned warnings for failed convergence for `r mw100_log_nonconverge`/100 of the conducted analyses, along with warnings for excessively large eigenvalues.

The pre-registered analysis plan did not provide contingencies for such widespread errors, so the relative costs and benefits of choosing analyses must be weighed after the fact. At this next step, it was decided post-hoc to attempt re-scaling age and Gini as standardized variables, in order to address the large eigenvalues, and hopefully eliminate the convergence issues.

Both for the models conducted on the 2004-06 and 1999-03 sweeps, scaling predictors for the ordinal analyses either made a negligible improvement to convergence issues (Table \@ref(tab:ord-log-converg-tab-99), or actually increased the number of models with errors (Table \@ref(tab:ord-log-converg-tab). As such, the logistic variants are reported for the main analyses, but the ordinal versions are available in the appendix (e.g., Figures\@ref(fig:icvs-ord-dwplot)).

<!-- This method of transforming the logistic analyses seems preferable as it retains more data than entirely deleting the non-identified ordinal models. However, the reduced set of weighted ordinal analyses will be reported for comparison with the logistic regression. -->

Initial analyses (weighted for population frequency, two-tailed tests) indicated null effects of income inequality on security consumption, logistic: `r tidy_extract(sec_mw100_log_scale_tidy,"gini_2004_6_scale", is.first=TRUE,test.stat=FALSE)`; however, there was a significant effect of GDP, `r tidy_extract(sec_mw100_log_scale_tidy,"gdppc_2004_6_scale",test.stat=FALSE)`. All individual-level predictors, except for gender were likewise significant (victimization experiences, age, employment status, *p* \< .001; Figure \@ref(fig:icvs-log-scale-dwplot); Table \@ref(tab:s3-logistic-scaled)).

<!-- ordinal; `r tidy_extract(sec_mw100_ord_drop_tidy,"gini_2004_6_cent")`  (Figures @ref(fig:icvs-log-scale-dwplot) and @ref(fig:icvs-ord-dwplot), respectively) -->

When the 1999-03 dataset was analyzed, there was a positive and significant effect of income inequality on security consumption, `r tidy_extract(sec_mw100_log_scale_1999_tidy,"gini_1999_03_scale")`. In this model, GDP did not reach significance thresholds, `r tidy_extract(sec_mw100_log_scale_1999_tidy,"gdppc_1999_03_scale",test.stat=FALSE)`.

Variability in coefficients between the 2004-06 and 1999-03 periods are difficult to interpret from the above models alone; any differences could be attributable to real differences in the data, or due to differences in model specification. The 1999 period has additional variables such as housing and relationship status, but is missing employment status. As such, robustness check models were conducted with a reduced variable set: Gini, gdp, victimization (nation- and individual-level), gender, and age. 

The coefficient patterns in the two above models generally held with reduced models. In the reduced model analyzing 2004-06 dataset, Gini continued to have no significant effect `r tidy_extract(sec_mw100_log_robust_scale_tidy,"gini_2004_6_scale",test.stat=FALSE)`. However, in this reduced model, the effect of gender (reporting as male) did change, reaching statistical significance, `r tidy_extract(sec_mw100_log_robust_scale_tidy,"male1",test.stat=FALSE)` (Figure \@ref(fig:icvs-log-robust-scale-dwplot) and Table \@ref(tab:s3-logistic-scaled-robust)). In the reduced 1999-03 model, the effect of the Gini remained positive and significant `r tidy_extract(sec_mw100_log_robust_scale_1999_tidy,"gini_1999_03_scale")`, the effect of GDP varied from the larger model, reaching statistical significance `r tidy_extract(sec_mw100_log_robust_scale_1999_tidy,"gdppc_1999_03_scale",test.stat=FALSE)` (Figure \@ref(fig:icvs-log-robust-scale-1999-dwplot) and Table \@ref(tab:s3-logistic-scaled-robust-1999)). 

The base model across both sweep periods proved to be a better fit than the reduced models. (AIC~(04-06)base-reduced~ = `r model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale["AIC"] - model_fits_sec_mw100_log_robust_scale["AIC"]`; AIC~(99-03)base-reduced~ = `r round(model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale_1999["AIC"] - model_fits_sec_mw100_log_robust_scale_1999["AIC"],2)`)

(BIC~(04-06)base-reduced~ = `r model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale["BIC"] - model_fits_sec_mw100_log_robust_scale["BIC"]`) (BIC~(99-03)base-reduced~ = `r model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale_1999["BIC"] - model_fits_sec_mw100_log_robust_scale_1999["BIC"]`)


Notably, treating security consumption as an ordinal did not change inequality's pattern of significance (nonsignificant for 04-06 period, significant for 99-03; 2004, Table \@ref(tab:s3-ord); 2004 reduced, Table \@ref(tab:s3-ord-robust-scale); 1999, Table \@ref(tab:s3-ord-99); 1999 reduced, Table \@ref(tab:s3-ord-99-robust))

#### Exploratory analyses:

The effect of Gini may be better described by something other than a simple linear effect. As exploratory analyses, models were fit for both the 2004 and 1999 datasets with an exponential term for income inequality, and an inequality\*GDP interaction. The exponential and interaction terms are reported within separate models, as within the same model, they introduce excessive multicollinearity in the model (max VIF = `r round(max(sec_lmer1_poly_int_vif),2)` for the Gini\*GDP interaction). For the 2004-2006 dataset, analyses of AIC values indicated that compared to the base model, including the interaction term produced a superior fit (AIC~base-int~ = `r model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale["AIC"] - model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale_int["AIC"]`). Conversely, the polynomial model is an insufficient improvement to fit beyond the base model (AIC~base-poly~ = `r model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale["AIC"] - model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale_poly["AIC"]`). Similarly, the polynomial is a worse fit to the interaction model (AIC~poly-int~ = `r model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale_poly["AIC"] - model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale_int["AIC"]`.

Another performance metric is the BIC, or Bayesian Information criterion, which has a stronger penalty for additional variables than the AIC. When using the BIC to evaluate the same models as above, the indices recommend using the base model with fewer variables. Smaller BIC values indicate a better fit. Compared to the base model, including the interaction term a worse fit (BIC~base-int~ = `r model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale["BIC"] - model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale_int["BIC"]`). Similarly, the polynomial model is an insufficient improvement to fit beyond the base model (BIC~base-poly~ = `r model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale["BIC"] - model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale_poly["BIC"]`). Again, the polynomial is a worse fit to the interaction model (BIC~poly-int~ = `r model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale_poly["BIC"] - model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale_int["BIC"]`.

Given the exploratory nature of these analyses, the BIC is likely a better fit index to guide decisions and inferences, as a means of controlling for Type I errors. In such a case, any coefficient change should be interpreted  as a spurious change that has no substantive impact on predicting security consumption.

<!-- Reference for BIC Long 1997:112 (0-2 weak, 2-6 positive, 6-10) -->

For the interaction-included model of the 2004 dataset, both the coefficients for income inequality, and the Gini\*GDP interaction were significant, `r tidy_extract(sec_mw100_log_scale_int_tidy,"gini_2004_6_scale")` and `r tidy_extract(sec_mw100_log_scale_int_tidy,"gini_gdp",test.stat=FALSE)`, respectively. 

For the 1999 dataset, AIC values indicated that the addition of neither interaction nor exponential terms sufficiently improved model fit beyond the base model (AIC differences = `r round(model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale_1999["AIC"] - model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale_int_1999["AIC"],3)` and `r round(model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale_1999["AIC"] - model_fits_sec_mw100_log_scale_poly_1999["AIC"],3)`, respectively. These models are thus only included in the appendix (Figures \@ref(fig:icvs-log-scale-int-1999-dwplot), \@ref(fig:icvs-log-scale-poly-1999-dwplot) and Tables \@ref(tab:s3-logistic-scaled-int-1999), \@ref(tab:s3-logistic-scaled-poly-1999)). In both of those models, inequality still had a significant and positive association with security consumption.

The results of Study 3 show a consistently positive effect of inequality on reported security consumption, with some variability in the effect's statistical significance. In the 1999 dataset, the effect of inequality was positive and significant across all model versions. In the 2004-06 data period, the effect of inequality was null until the Gini\*gdp interaction was added. With the exploratory addition of the (positive and significant) interaction term, the main effect of inequality was significantly positive. However, adding the Gini\*GDP term only improved model fit when assessed by the AIC. When a more conservative index of model fit was used (BIC), adding the Gini\*gdp term did not adequately improve model fit.

<!-- Notably, these significance patterns would hold if the inequality and Gini\*gdp terms were subject to a bonferonni correction, reducing the significance threshold from .05 to .025.  -->

Even with reduced analyses with identical predictor variables, a significant effect of inequality was found in the  1999-03 period, but not the 2004-06 period. After ruling out differences in model specifications, the change in inequality's significance between sweep periods may be attributable to the slightly larger number of clustering units for this level-2 effect (k = 41 vs. k = 32), resulting in smaller standard errors. Likewise, the effect of inequality trended towards being larger in the 1999-03 period, `r tidy_extract(sec_mw100_log_robust_scale_1999_tidy,"gini_1999_03_scale",test.stat=FALSE, p.val = FALSE)`, compared to the 2004-06 period, `r tidy_extract(sec_mw100_log_robust_scale_tidy,"gini_2004_6_scale",test.stat=FALSE, p.val = FALSE)`. As discussed earlier, there is a substantial difference in the countries covered between the 1999-03 and 2004-06 period (e.g., 1999-03 is unique in including countries like Botswana, Panama, Philippines, and Ukraine, but is missing countries such as Austria, Iceland, Italy, and Mexico). The 1999-03 sweep generally has better coverage of countries in Africa, South America, and Asia, and has larger Gini values (max~99~ = `r round(max(nation_vars_1999$gini_1999_03),1)`, mean~99~ = `r round(mean(nation_vars_1999$gini_1999_03),1)`; max~04~ = `r round(max(gd$gini_2004_6),1)`, mean~04~ = `r round(mean(gd$gini_2004_6),1)`). 


It remains ambiguous why the 1999-03 sweep trended towards a larger effect than the 2004-06 sweep. One feasible explanation is that the 1999-03 sweep included more high-inequality, high-security countries. In addition to lower mean levels of inequality, the 2004-2006 period has higher skewness, skew~2004~ = `r round(moments::skewness(gd$gini_2004_6),1)`, skew~1999~ = `r round(moments::skewness(nation_vars_1999$gini_1999_03),1)`. Such an explanation would suggest that in the 2004-6 sweep, high-inequality countries were simply undersampled, with the few high-inequality countries providing a downward-biased picture of the relationship between inequality ad security consumption, with surveyed countries perhaps having higher country-level trust and institutional integrity to begin with. Another possible explanation is the differences between sweep periods has introduced some meaningful confounding variables. Likely culprits such as GDP or victimization experiences are already accounted for in the regression models. Likewise, a more mature security market seems like an unlikely explanation, as the 1999-03 sweep had reported a higher mean security units consumed than the 2004 period (*M~99~* = `r round(mean(nation_vars_1999$total_security),1)`, *skew~99~* =  `r round(moments::skewness(nation_vars_1999$total_security),1)`; *M~04~* =  `r round(mean(gd$total_security),1)`, *skew~04~* = `r round(moments::skewness(gd$total_security),1)`).

<!-- The inequality-security relationship might be weaker amongst WEIRD countries (particularly those in Western Europe).  -->

One exploratory consideration could be to analyze both the 2004-06 and 1999-03 sweeps with reduced variables, along with reduced countries, so that the only differences between the 2004-06 and 1999-03 models would be the time period and the individual respondents surveyed. However, this analysis would result in only a small number of level-2 units (k = `r length(intersect(iv_2005_countries,responders_1999_countries))`), yielding effect estimates with large standard errors. Figure \@ref(fig:icvs-sec-ineq-scat-min) shows that both sweeps have positive trending relationships, and that this relationship is trending towards being larger in the 1999-03 sweep. Since the models and countries are the same, any difference in the inequality-security effect must be attributable to the time period of the survey, any differences in the survey itself, or the individuals sampled. 

A contrast between Figures \@ref(fig:icvs-sec-ineq-scat) and \@ref(fig:icvs-sec-ineq-scat-min) is also suggestive that the inequality relationship for the 2004-06 period is made stronger by removing the countries that were exclusively surveyed in this time period. The small number of countries examined is too small for any statistical analysis, but raises the possibility that the countries exclusive to the 2004-06 period may have a particularly low correlation between inequality and security consumption. 


However, any of these post-hoc, reduced-country analyses are underpowered and should be interpreted with substantial caution. 


<!-- Likewise, there seems to be a modestly larger amount of recorded security consumption in the 1999-03 sweep than the 2004-06 sweep. This would be a surprising trend; many of the home security features analyzed in this study are installed devices, such as barred windows or special locks.  After the initial purchase and installation, they would generally remain for a moderate period of time; one would expect that these features wouldn't be removed within five years of being installed, even when new owners would take possession of a property. Such a discrepancy raises the possibility of some systematic aberrations in how the security measures were recorded between the sweep periods - did all of the individuals in all of the countries see the same security items? -->

Given that the measure of security consumption was constructed largely out of items concerning home security, the 1999-03 sweep period was especially important because it offered the opportunity to control for one's housing. For instance, one would expect the result that individuals report more security measures when they lived in a house instead of apartment, as their residences are more likely to be at the ground level, and they have more autonomy to install security measures after moving in. Likewise, the inclusion of these housing variables helps to control for any confounding or suppressing effects. For instance, high-inequality countries could conceivably have fewer individuals in houses, artificially weakening the relationship between inequality and security consumption.

There was no single model specification that could be used to consistently describe both sweep periods. For instance, the Gini\*GDP interaction improved the model fit for the 2004-06 period, but only when using AIC as the index for model evaluation. Similarly, the interaction did not improve the fit on the 1999-03 data.  The Gini\*GDP interaction was an exploratory inclusion, so any interpretations are post-hoc. Although the simultaneous inclusion of Gini and GDP as main effect variables means that Gini and GDP are not confounded in this analysis, their interaction might remain practically, if not theoretically, meaningful.

One possible explanation of the Gini\*GDP interaction is that people are sensitive to the magnitude of economic differences within a society, recognizing that a large Gini in a wealthy country means that the upper crust of a society controls a much larger absolute dollar value than a poorer country (e.g., one person controlling 50% of \$100 versus \$1 million). Additionally, the distrust- and fear-inducing effect of inequality may be obscured by the average individuals' reduced purchasing power. High inequality means that any person is less likely to control a sizeable portion of a country's income, so is more likely to be poorer in absolute terms, so they may have less disposable income to spend on security products. Likewise, at least at a cross-sectional basis, the Gini and GDP are negatively correlated [@ourworldindata2019], generally reflecting that when the pool of a country's income is split more unevenly, the overall standard of living also tends to be lower. The significant Gini\*GDP interaction may suggest that if a country is more unequal and more prosperous, individuals do feel more fearful and distrustful, and they may be using their small "slice" of the large economic "pie" to satisfy their felt need for greater security.

The 1999 sweep failed to find an effect of the Gini\*GDP interaction, which could be attributable to either the different set of countries that was included, or the 3-7 year difference from the 2004-06 sweep. The security market may have matured significantly between 1999 and 2004-06, where even lower-tech security measures such as window grills may have become more accessible, as the market has matured.

#### Limitations

Study 3's use of archival data has some notable limitations. Since many countries in the ICVS were surveyed as part of distinct contracts, they vary to the degree that sampling is representative of an entire country. For instance, some countries are only surveyed from a single city. Similarly, the data reported from the ICVS is fairly old. The overall consumption landscape, and the security industry specifically, has seen some substantial changes since the late 1990s and early 2000s. As such, the relationship between nation-level inequality and security consumption might change over other years. Likewise, any conclusions drawn from analyzing the ICVS will be limited due to the ICVS' biased and restricted selection of countries. The countries that participated were not randomly sampled, but instead out of some degree of convenience and feasibility, introducing a bias into the economic and political makeup of the countries selected.

Sampling bias

The cross-sectional analysis of inequality and security may may be a poor specification of how inequality would actualy impact security. For instance, @daly2016 suggests that for the relationship between homicide and inequality could be better described as time-lagged, where the effects of inequality on behaviour "must be mediated in some sort of cumulative influence of our past experiences" (p.150).

The measurement of security measures is limited to self-report measures of household protection methods. As such, for many individuals, many of their security measures may have been an incidental or pre-existing feature of their residence. For instance, a consumer may choose to purchase a house for its desirable location, but the consumer does not care that the property comes bundled with some security features such as heavy-duty locks or barred windows. Personal protection measures (e.g., carrying a can of mace, avoiding going out at certain times) would likely be more salient and intentional to respondents. With this possibility of consumers being indifferent about some security measures, the self-report nature of security consumption also introduces the possibility of measurement error that respondents simply do not remember or notice some security features on their property.

The use of logistic regressions carries the risk of some  misleading conclusions. Dichotomizing security consumption means treating the variable as all-or-nothing. However, there could be a meaningful loss of information by reducing the full range of values. For instance, it could be the case that many people end up with one unit of security consumption spuriously, but it is the higher units of security consumption  may have the stronger relationship with inequality.



Additionally, the method of computing security consumption had to make some assumptions of how missing values were generated. 

As it stands, individual weights have not been used when computing compositional variables.

The model specification would be improved by the addition of covariates such as income, ethnicity, neighborhood type

The presence of models that have some convergence issues may reduce the robustness of estimates, whether it is due to the selective use of models without convergence issues, or the inclusion of models that do have convergence issues.
