Income and wealth inequalities can vary dramatically between countries, cities, and time periods. For instance, inequality has risen in the US over the past 30 years [@horowitz2020], and even moreso in China. There is substantial debate whether such an increase in inequality should be embraced as a byproduct of differences in productivity, or resisted as a corrosive force of injustice.

Inequality's moral and political significance is closely linked to its impacts on people's psychology and behaviour. At a societal level, inequality has been associated with higher homicide rates [@daly2016], consumer debt [@christen2005], and reduced cooperation [@burton-chellew2013 ; @anderson2008], while at an individual level, inequality causes people to be more likely to resort to risky and hostile activities in desperate attempts to compete for otherwise inaccessible positions and resources [@mishra2015; @payne2017; @krupp2018]. This dissertation seeks to examine whether inequality causes a special case of risk aversion: social distrust, and increases individuals' willingness to consume security products.

This project aims to test an envy anticipation model of distrust and its ability to predict security consumption. This theory will be tested through a multimethod project of four experiments (Studies 1a&b, 2a&b) and a multilevel analysis of archival data using the International Crime Victimization Survey (ICVS; Study 3). Chapter 1 will provide an initial test of the inequality-distrust relationship through a series of economic games, using crowdsourced participants. These experiments will manipulate inequality and test a mechanism of envy avoidance: that **H1)** `r tolower(hypotheses[1])` (see Table \@ref(tab:design-table) for hypotheses and design table) because **H2)** people expect disadvantaged peers to experience envy. Using the same game context with crowdsourced participants, Chapter 2 examines the impact of distributional fairness on security consumption, testing the predictions that **H3)** `r tolower(hypotheses[2])`, and that **H4)** Individuals will consume more security when inequality is the apparent result of group-based favoritism. Lastly, Chapter 3 describes a multilevel analysis using the International Crime Victimization Survey [@vankesteren2010], to test whether **H5)** `r tolower(hypotheses[4])`.

## Risk-Taking and Inequality

The decision of when and whether to take a risk can have tremendous effects on individual and collective outcomes. For instance, individuals make choices to start businesses, gamble, participate in extreme sports, or engage in criminal activities. These activities vary to the extent that they are encouraged or prohibited, but they all share an element of risk - they can go very well, or very poorly. For this project, risk is defined as higher variability in outcomes [reviewed in @mishra2014]. For instance, a 10% chance at winning \$30 (versus getting nothing) compared to getting \$3 guaranteed have the same expected value; repeating each choice 100 times yields about the same average payoff of \$3. However, the 10% chance at \$30 has a wider range of possible outcomes, and is thus more risky. Importantly, growing evidence indicates that risk-seeking does not occur arbitrarily, and can often be considered as an adaptive response to given circumstances.

The animal behaviour literature has highlighted the importance of thresholds in guiding risk-taking behaviours. For instance, the energy budget rule describes how organisms *should* accept more risky foraging strategies when low-risk alternatives fail to meet individuals' 24-hour energy requirements [@caraco1980; @stephens1981]. This energy budget rule is but one instance of the broader *risk-sensitivity theory* (aka risk-sensitivity foraging theory), which has been extended to studies of human risk-taking [e.g., @mishra2010]. Using currencies beyond nutritional requirements (e.g., money, social status, survival decisions), studies have demonstrated that conditions of need continue to elicit increased risk-taking, consistent with risk-sensitivity theory [@pietras2001; @rode1999; @island2007; @wang2002].

Following from risk-sensitivity theory, two accounts have been proposed to explain how population-level inequality influences risk-taking in individuals. First, inequality increases risk-taking through *absolute deprivation*; unequal societies tend to have more poverty, leading many people to take risks to meet their basic needs [@pridemore2008]. Second, risk-taking can be a response to *relative deprivation*, where even well-off individuals feel disadvantaged when compared to other individuals or imagined states, taking risks in an attempt to keep up with peers and a subjective reference point [@mishra2017].

The effect of relative deprivation on risk-taking is a fairly recent extension of risk-sensitivity theory. Chiefly, the role of reletive deprivation is captured by the so-called "positional bias," whereby humans judge success relative to others, instead of in absolute terms [@hill2006]. For instance, individuals are more likely to report lower life satisfaction if they made less money than their co-workers [@frank2001]. Half of individuals prefer less purchasing power in order to have more money relative to peers [@solnick1998a]. Merely suggesting to participants that they have less money than "similar others" induces feelings of relative deprivation and gambling behaviours [@callan2008]. Likewise, inequality leads to feelings of envy and spiteful behaviours [@wobker2015].

@hill2006 suggest that the positional bias is an adaptive response to the inherently competitive nature of darwinian fitness. Since resource access is is necessary for survival, health, and reproduction, individuals who monopolize resources will pass a greater share of their genes onto future generations [@hamilton1964]. In competitive environments, organisms that fail to notice or counter their own disadvantage (i.e., those that lack a positional bias) should see their genetic representation decline over time [@garay2011].

Together, inequality fosters risk-taking by increasing the distance between individuals and their goals. Inequality causes absolute deprivation because the skewed distribution of resources make it increasingly difficult for a person to meet a relatively stable level of need (e.g., paying rent). By contrast, inequality causes relative deprivation through increasingly extreme social comparisons, leading individuals to similarly skew their aspiration levels ever higher.

This dissertation is inspired by considering the social consequences of this inequality-risk relationship. If inequality causes people to take more risks and/or behave in a hostile manner, would people in the same unequal environment come to expect harmful behaviours from their neighbors? Chapter one will elaborate on this envy anticipation hypothesis of distrust, which predicts that in the presence of inequality, concerns over partners' envy will drive people to pay to secure themselves against social threats.

<!--# predicts that across domains of darwinian fitness (e.g., status, mate access), individuals will generally be averse to risk, but will switch to risk-seeking when they expect to fall short of their goals using predictable strategies. -->

<!--# have preferences over rewards' probability distributions, and that these preferences change based on the circumstances. Namely, risk-sensitivity theory predicts that individuals  -->

<!--# local risk aversion (Pratt, 1964) -->

<!--# risk-sensitivity theory has been demonstrated to account for substantial variance in risk-taking behaviours under conditions of need  -->

<!--# (i.e., they are sensitive rather than unaffected by an option's variability) -->

<!--# keep the individual from starvation -->

<!--# While the role of risk in decision-making has a long history in the decision sciences (e.g., expected value, expected utility theories) Risky foraging, energy budget rule -->

<!--# One theory seeking to explain the processes of domain-specific versus general risk-taking is the relative state model [@mishra2017], which posits that both environmental and embodied factors interact in social landscapes to yield two distinct pathways towards risk-taking behaviours. In this model, domain-specific risk-taking is argued to occur through an ability-based pathway, whereby one's superior capital (e.g., physical ability) increases the expected value of some risky activities (e.g., rock climbing), but not others (investment banking).  -->

<!--# Risk-sensitivity theory has some obvious parallels with models from other disciplines. For instance, the strain theory of deviance in sociology and criminology [e.g., @agnew1996] suggests that criminal activities are caused by a "strain" between societal goals (primarily monetary) and legitimate means to achieve them, which leads to an overall dissatisfaction with one's lot in life. Risk-sensitivity theory also shares features with prospect theory. Most notably, prospect theory also hinges on a reference point, after which further gains are subject to diminishing sensitivity.  -->

<!--# While prospect theory has a large number of parameters (reference point, probability weighting function, concavity/convexity parameters in the domain of gains/losses, and loss aversion parameter), risk-sensitivity theory offers a more simple heuristic guide for when to take risks. As a result, risk-sensitivity theory and is less susceptible to overfitting parameters to a single dataset, which is a common criticism of prospect theory [@brandstÃ¤tter2006]. -->

<!--# One extension of risk-sensitivity theory is in the relative state model  [@mishra2017], which seeks to explain observations that many risk-taking behaviours co-occur within individuals (i.e., risk-taking's domain-generality). The relative state model posits that both environmental and embodied factors interact with social landscapes to yield a subjective evaluation of overall (dis)advantage. Accordingly, individuals with disadvantaged relative state (i.e., in a state of need), are more likely to take risks in many areas (e.g., gambling, lying) because their insufficient capital (e.g., money) leaves them unable to effectively reach their goals. This project focuses specifically on the need-based pathway, and its social consequences. -->

<!--# Conversely, domain-general risk-taking occurs through a need-based pathway. In this need-based pathway, individuals take risks  -->

<!--# The need-based pathway follows from risk-sensitivity theory, which predicts that organisms will increase risk-taking when more predictable strategies cannot meet the organism's goals [e.g., starvation thresholds; see @caraco1980]. -->

<!--# to set more ambitious goals as their perceived minimum -->

<!--# by moving the subjective thresholds for these goals through increasingly extreme social comparisons.  -->

<!-- For instance, @solnick1998 found that half of participants would sacrifice their overall purchasing power in order to have more money than their peers. -->

<!--# Relative deprivation theory [@smith2012] and unfairness theory [@cropanzano2001] also both suggest that individuals' judgments of satisfaction and unfairness are largely formed by counterfactual comparisons. According to these theories, people judge whether they are worse off compared to another potential state of being, which can be heavily influenced by past states or social comparisons with other individuals. -->

## Security - A Typology of Protection

<!-- Protective consumption -->

<!-- -  Security consumption conceptual clarity -->

<!-- o  Distinguish from security behaviours/specify interrelationship -->

<!-- -  Fear appeals -->

<!-- o  Services marketing/service dominant logic -->

The pursuit of security is fundamental to human life; we lock our car doors, purchase insurance, stockpile protective equipment, and flee unstable countries. Many markets are directly and indirectly influenced by this desire for security. In the United States, insurance premiums totaled to \$1.2 trillion in 2017 [@insuranceinformationinstitute2020a]. Likewise, people who are concerned for their safety are less likely to use of public transportation [@delbosc2012; @loukaitou-sideris1997]. The pursuit of security can require large tradeoffs for consumers; every dollar spent on a heavy-duty deadbolt or theft insurance cannot be spent on other goods such as savings, recreation, or healthcare. Individuals' purchasing and use of products that seek to increase one's security are of particular interest for this project, or what will be termed security consumption.

As much as I would like to take credit for being original in thinking about security, there has been plenty of work on this topic, particularly within sociology. The pursuit of security can be found under many different names: <!--# constrained behaviors, defensive behaviours, guardianship, precautions, precautionary behaviours, precautionary measures, preventive measures, protective behaviours, Protective Actions, risk avoidance, risk-reducing behaviours, routine activities, safety measures, safety behaviours, safety precautions, security behaviours,  self-protection, self-protective behaviours (avoidance, active security)  -->

> *constrained behaviors, defensive behaviours, precautions, preventive measures, protective behaviours, routine activities, safety precautions, security behaviours, self-protection (avoidance, active security)*

Take your pick. In addition to increasing the difficulty of searching the literature, this flood of labels also obscures when articles are examining the same constructs and theories. However, throughout this literature, all of these terms seem to consistently share four aspects. They capture an expenditure of resources (money, time, effort, space, attention, social capital, opportunity) that helps the agent and/or their ingroup (e.g., family, neighbors, co-workers) to (a) recover from, (b) cope with, (c) avoid, and/or (d) deter hazards.

@dubow1979 defined a similar suite of 'behavioural reactions to crime': a) avoidance ("increasing distance from situations [perceived to be risky], b) personal and home protection ("increasing resistance to victimization), c) insurance (minimizing costs without reducing exposure or resistance... keeping valuables in a safe deposit box to reduce the potential loss when victimized), d) communicative behaviour ("sharing of information and emotions related to crime with others"), e) participatory behaviour ("action taken with others... may be informally or formally organized"). They also provide a detailed breakdown of each of these components (e.g., avoidance consisting of i) spatial/temporal, ii) situational, iii) activity-specific, iv) supervision of yoith, v) transportation choices, vi) relocation decisions).

@miethe1995 talks about avoidance, protective, general behavioural and lifestyl changes, and collective activities

(before encountering a harm): avoid, deter

@shavell1991 invokes the varying visibility of protective measures

(upon encountering a harm): coping, recovery

avoidance and defensive behaviours have been examined in the past [e.g., avoidance and defensive behavior @rader2007]

'items that people place in their homes for security reasons'' (hereafter referred to as defensive behaviors)'

All things being equal, an effective avoidance strategy should be preferred to any other security measure. Given the sequential nature of these measures, successful avoidance can effectively stop thefts before they've had a chance to begin; a prospective thief will have a hard time breaking into a house that they do not see or know about. Similarly, if a thief does detect an opportunity, an effective deterrence measure can dissuade the thief from even attempting a criminal activity, perhaps having them select a neighbor instead, or abandoning the thieving enterprise altogether (diversion and deterrence respectively, in @shavell1991).

@san-juan2012

> According to the study by Killias (1990), vulnerability is related to exposure to risk (for example, the case of taxi drivers), the damage incurred (the consequences of an attack involving physical harm are more serious for an elderly person), or the inability to deal with an attack (women or physically weak people can feel defenceless against possible attack).

Includes 'Incidental security,' as part of a bundle? (e.g., apartment with improved locks, but you bought it as a bundle). Incidental security will be more common with more expensive product categories, as well as the more expensive alternatives within those categories

security measures vs. behaviours: measures can be put in place and kept with little concern or upkeep, others need to be actively done repeatedly (potential overlap - subscription based services, more likely to be a measure though)

@mesch1998 makes a distinction between personal and household protective behaviours.

> Individual crime prevention is based on the assumption that the anticipation or recognition of a crime risk naturally calls for some action to remove the threat (Rosenbaum, 1988). Most studies on individual crime prevention have limited themselves to one kind of behaviour: either household protection (Lab, 1990; Garofalo and Clark, 1992) or personal protection (Smith and Uchida, 1988; Young et al., 1987). Such compartmentalization does not allow us to fully understand the nature of protective behaviour and whether personal and household crime protective behaviours are driven by the same factors (see Skogan and Maxfield, 1981 for an exception).

The idea of security is expansive, rooted in the Latin term *securitas*, meaning freedom from care or anxiety. So, (in)security can occur in many areas, ranging from health, employment, natural disasters, nutrition, as well as conflicts between individuals or nations. Given its potential breadth, a concept of security consumption must be clarified in terms of its relevant domains and forms. At its most comprehensive, security consumption could be considered as any prevention-focused activity, conducted by an agent seeking to minimize the expected costs from harms. With such a wide-ranging definition, security consumption can be carried out by individual consumers, organizations, as well as nation-states.

Scholars in risk management classify any source of costs as a hazard, whereas threats are defined as warnings that something unpleasant may occur [@brunschot2007]. Given the conceptual breadth of consumer behaviour [@macinnis2010], security consumption can be defined as an expenditure of resources in the consumer context that helps the agent to (a) recover from, (b) cope with, (c) avoid, and/or (d) deter hazards. Notably, security behaviours do not always manifest in the consumer context; for instance, someone might be concerned about being victimized by a burglary and develop habits of checking their locks, or limiting their exposure to high-risk areas. Although such vigilance might improve one's ability to cope with an intruder, or prevent victimization altogether, it does not manifest in meaningful exchanges within the security market. Thus, security behaviours are best understood as antecedent or moderating variables in the decision to consume security goods and services.

*Recovery* corresponds namely to purchasing insurance. Although many types of insurance are necessary for all drivers, some people purchase extra insurance to help recuperate costs from events like collisions or vandalism. *Coping* refers to goods and services that help agents reduce the costs incurred when exposed to harms. For instance, a fire extinguisher helps in coping with flammable hazards, such that when it occurs, a fire can be smothered before it causes substantial harm. Likewise, individuals can expend resources to *avoid* certain hazards, for instance, people might invest substantial resources in the process of moving away from regions that suffer from crime, air pollution, or natural disasters. Lastly, agents can consume security goods that are meant as *deterrents* for potentially antagonistic actors. For instance, someone might purchase a "beware of dog" sign for their property to deter intruders, when they in fact do not own a dog.

Importantly, many security goods and services fill multiple roles simultaneously. For example, moving into a gated community may 1) help their residence avoid being near and visible to criminals, 2) have protective measures that help to cope with attempted thefts, and 3) deter criminals' willingness to attempt a theft, due to the perceived risk of getting caught or hurt. This definition of security consumption appears to be capable of incorporating and differentiating a wide variety of security behaviours.

Security consumption has been argued to be a form of 'grudge spending,' non-conspicuous mode of consumption that typically exists outside of the paraphernalia of consumer culture where consumers do not want to invest in security or see it as a benefit [@loader2015]

Security consumption being both direct and indirect - security concerns can change other consumption behaviours, for instance fostering a reluctance to consume certain products or in certain spaces [@goold2010] [@delbosc2012; @loukaitou-sideris1997]

> other words, organizational security consumption isperformed onbehalf ofothers bypurchasers whoaimtocreate physical (andvirtual)spaces thatfeelappropriately secure totheirusers, andaretherefore likely toattract andretain customers

The physical security industry has been projected to increase 29% between 2021 and 2025 [@marketsandmarkets2021], which likely is heavily impacted by organizations and nations. Understanding security consumption by institutions (i.e., business-to-business and business-to-government marketing) is important, as government and private organizations likewise seek to recover from, cope with, avoid, and deter harms. However, the contexts of such institutional decisions (e.g., institutional prestige, political leverage), the hazards (nuclear strikes by other countries), and the products available (armed drones), are distinct from the security decisions of everyday consumers. To avoid confusing organizations and individuals, this proposal will focus on security consumption amongst individual consumers, such limitation in scope will help to develop and explicate microfoundations of security consumption, which may eventually be generalized or modified to other security market contexts.

## Social Conflict as a Security Hazard - and the Importance of (Dis)trust

Ensuring the safety of one's body and resources against hostile behaviours is an essential life function. For instance, tadpoles are quick to abandon rich food sources when exposed to a chemical "alarm substance" secreted from other injured tadpoles [@petranka1989]. The risk of predation has been argued to have selected for vigilance and defensive strategies across the animal kingdom [e.g., @beauchamp2015]. Such defensive strategies can be seen in the tissue-regeneration of starfishes, aggressive behaviours in honey badgers, camouflage in stick insects, and the bright coloration of non-venomous animals such as the milk snake. Likewise, humans and our ancestors have historically faced predation by other animals [@hart2011], which have been argued to generate defensive adaptations in modern humans, such as leveraging social groups to collectively monitor for hazards [@kameda2007].

While the risk of predation by other species seems to have a profound effect on security behaviours in humans, other people have proven to be a substantial hazard to our ancestors and contemporaries alike. Currently, other humans (via murder) are only outranked by mosquitoes as the deadliest animal to modern *Homo sapiens* [@gates2014]. Given the costs of being victim to acts of hostility, and the benefits of cooperation [@henrich2001a], the identification of friends versus enemies is a fundamental strategic problem in human interaction.

The classification of friends versus enemies is neatly captured the psychological process of trust/distrust; these polar opposites generally reflecting our belief whether another person's actions will be beneficial versus harmful to us [@kramer1999; @schul2008]. Trust is important for navigating so-called 'commitment problems,' where individuals can benefit if they can convince their social partners that they are fully committed to a course of action [marriage, business contracts; @frank1988]. By making an accurate judgment of who to trust and distrust, individuals can maintain longstanding and beneficial cooperative relationships, and likewise avoid leaving themselves vulnerable to harmful partners. Overall, trust can impact willingness to cooperate [@balliet2013] the politicians we vote for, the companies we buy from [@hong2013], satisfaction after negotiations [@kong2014] and the relationships we keep (REF?), so the processes and predictors of trust have understandably attracted a great deal of attention.

As mentioned earlier, hazards can come from a variety of sources (natural disasters, economic instability, pandemics). However, this proposal will focus on the threats posed by other people. This emphasis on social sources of harm reveals how decision-makers must consider others' intentions when deciding whether to purchase security goods. Specifically, security behaviours are heavily influenced by the hypothetical imperative: *if I expect others to [try to steal]{.ul}, my best response is to [purchase security products]{.ul}*; [@hargreaves-heap2004a]. Given humans' characteristic reliance on markets to meet their needs, the remainder of this project will rest on the assumption that acts of security consumption (that protect against social hazards) are at least partly an expression of consumer distrust of other agents.

Some behavioural evidence suggests that people can be overly distrustful. @mcevily2012 found that in a behavioural distrust game, participants tended to spend too much money to prevent their partner from keeping large sums of shared wealth. Paradoxically, security consumption can increase one's vulnerability to victimizations. Surveying South African suburbs and security practitioners, @marks2015 found that households surrounded with high walls have obstructed lines of sight to and from the property, reducing the effectiveness of police patrols and "natural surveillance" by neighbors.

<!-- This project aims to test an envy anticipation model of distrust and its ability to predict security consumption. Specifically, this project will test the prediction that **H1)** `r tolower(hypotheses[1])` (see Table @ref(tab:design-table) for hypotheses and design table) because **H2)** people expect disadvantaged peers to experience envy. Addressing the moderating effects of fairness on the effects of inequality, this project will also test the prediction that **H3)** `r tolower(hypotheses[2])`, and that **H4)** Individuals will consume more security when inequality is the apparent result of group-based favoritism. This theory will be tested through a multimethod project of four experiments (Studies 1a&b, 2a&b) and a multilevel analysis of archival data using the International Crime Victimization Survey (ICVS; Study 3) [@vankesteren2010] to test whether **H5)** `r tolower(hypotheses[4])` . -->
